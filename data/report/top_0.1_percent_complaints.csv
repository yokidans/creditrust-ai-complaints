5/15/2025,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I was contacted by a pop up on my laptop in XX/XX/XXXX. It said there was a problem with my account and to call some number. I called it and the person told me I was a victim of identity theft/fraud due to the Cloud Strike hack and I would have to move my money. I talked to XXXX XXXX who worked for XXXX. She then transferred '' me to "" XXXX with the bank. XXXX kept calling me almost everyday until XXXX. They told me to not tell anyone about this, because they dont know who is behind this. Every time XXXX transferred me directly to XXXX, who had an XXXX accent. They told me I had to move the money around to protect it but I was going to get it all back. 

They first had me wire transfer {$30000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX from my XXXX Bank account. XXXX was suspicious of this transfer and stopped it, and returned the money ( minus the wire transfer fee I think ).

My daughter found out all this was going on and flew to help me on XX/XX/XXXX. We found out all this added up to {$400000.00} that Citi let me wire transfer. I have never moved money in this manner before. We called to submit the fraud complaint and try to recover some of the money. We also filed a police report. Citibank has ultimately said they are "" unable to reach the XXXXXXXX XXXX to obtain a return of the funds '' for the first XXXX transactions. For all the remaining transactions, we have received a letter stating "" We have completed our investigation of your fraud claim ( for the remaining {$310000.00} wire transferred between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ).

'' They said on the phone they might be able to recover some of the money from the XXXX most recent months of transactions, but it seems as if they gave up very quickly in recovering my money.

I think if my small local bank ( Truist ) was able to flag these as fraudulent activity, Citi should have been able to do so as well. It seems they were negligent. Possibly they should have verified when the receiving account was opened and who opened it. Was ID asked for? Did they verify their identity with another source like Equifax?
