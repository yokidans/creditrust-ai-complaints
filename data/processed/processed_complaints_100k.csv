2025-06-15,mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Changes in loan terms during the application process,"I signed a purchase agreement with Lennar Corporation on XX/XX/year>, for a new construction home in XXXX, Illinois that was not scheduled to be built until XXXX of XXXX. I submitted a total deposit of {$15000.00} based on monthly mortgage payment estimates and a home price that were provided to me by Lennars representatives. These payment figures were communicated informally through text messages, emails and not through proper loan disclosures. 

After I paid the full deposit, Lennar informed me that those numbers were incorrect and that I could no longer receive the previously quoted terms. Their disclosures also changed multiple times, and after I raised concerns, Lennar revoked my access to their loan portal preventing me from reviewing or documenting the various versions of those disclosures.

When I asked for a refund based on these errors, Lennar refused. Instead, they stated that I was in default and would lose the entire deposit unless I agreed to purchase another Lennar home. I do not want to continue doing business with Lennar under these circumstances.

I believe this situation involves misrepresentation, failure to disclose accurate loan terms in writing before requesting funds, and financial coercion. I was pressured to increase my deposit based on figures that turned out to be inaccurate, and now Lennar is using the contract to justify keeping the deposit after altering key terms.

I am requesting a full or partial refund of my {$15000.00} deposit and for the CFPB to investigate whether Lennar and/or its affiliated lender violated federal consumer finance laws including the Truth in Lending Act and protections against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Lennar Financial Services, LLC",IL,60538,,Consent provided,Web,6/15/2025,Closed with explanation,Yes,,14089944,"i signed a purchase agreement with lennar corporation on xxxxyear, for a new construction home in xxxx, illinois that was not scheduled to be built until xxxx of xxxx. i submitted a total deposit of 15000.00 based on monthly mortgage payment estimates and a home price that were provided to me by lennars representatives. these payment figures were communicated informally through text messages, emails and not through proper loan disclosures. after i paid the full deposit, lennar informed me that those numbers were incorrect and that i could no longer receive the previously quoted terms. their disclosures also changed multiple times, and after i raised concerns, lennar revoked my access to their loan portal preventing me from reviewing or documenting the various versions of those disclosures. when i asked for a refund based on these errors, lennar refused. instead, they stated that i was in default and would lose the entire deposit unless i agreed to purchase another lennar home. i do not want to continue doing business with lennar under these circumstances. i believe this situation involves misrepresentation, failure to disclose accurate loan terms in writing before requesting funds, and financial coercion. i was pressured to increase my deposit based on figures that turned out to be inaccurate, and now lennar is using the contract to justify keeping the deposit after altering key terms. i am requesting a full or partial refund of my 15000.00 deposit and for the cfpb to investigate whether lennar andor its affiliated lender violated federal consumer finance laws including the truth in lending act and protections against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices udaap .",2025-06,272

My dispute case number was XXXX. I singed and paid this contract on XX/XX/XXXX. I found out this was fraudulent transaction in XXXX of XXXX and filed my dispute XX/XX/XXXX. Truist has since denied my dispute for no correct or apparent reason that is applicable to the reason I disputed the charge. This case involves over 400 others and has been escalated to the SEC, FTC, and FBI. This is the letter along with other supporting documents I sent to Truist : This letter outlines my formal dispute and request for chargeback regarding undelivered commercial trucking services I contracted through XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The dispute relates to payments made via XXXX, funded through Truist business credit card totaling {$12000.00}. Although funds were transmitted through XXXX, these payments were in no shape or form a gift. They were for contracted services that were misrepresented, only partially rendered, and ultimately abandoned. 
Please refer to the contract attached. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX 's recent notice claims banking and payment processing issues caused by their subcontractor, XXXX XXXX XXXX, constitute a Force Majeure event. Additionally, stating XXXX XXXX XXXX was never in possession of leased trucks as that was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( their subcontractor ). However, banking issues, subcontractor failures, and business partner defaults are normal business risks, not extraordinary Force Majeure events like natural disasters, wars, pandemics, or government shutdowns, etc. 
My contract is directly with XXXX XXXX XXXX. Their subcontractors ' failures do not absolve them of their direct obligations to me under the contract. Courts consistently hold that internal partner or vendor problems do not excuse nonperformance unless explicitly stated, which is not the case here. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX attempt to attribute blame to subcontractors ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) does not absolve them of liability. Under basic contract law principles, a company can not contract away its obligations by outsourcing to third parties. The risk of subcontractor nonperformance remains entirely with XXXX XXXX XXXX, who was directly responsible for fulfilling the services promised to me. 
Therefore, their failure to make the guaranteed weekly payments constitutes a breach of contract and fraud, not a valid Force Majeure event. I respectfully request that this dispute be resolved in my favor. 
This dispute involves a substantial business loss totaling {$12000.00} across my Truist business credit card, as well as an additional {$41000.00} related to other business cards being disputed and tied to undelivered services and mismanagement of funds. Totaling in {$52000.00} as stated in the contract. These funds were provided in exchange for the expectation of truck leasing, weekly operational income, insurance, driver coordination, and full commercial fleet management all outlined in the signed agreement.

2025-04-14,mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Changes in loan terms during the application process,"I am writing to file a formal complaint against FirstBank, located in XXXX XXXX, regarding what I believe to be predatory lending practices and mishandling of our construction loan. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, my husband and I were approved for a construction loan in the amount of {>= $1,000,000}. At the time of approval, our debt-to-income ( DTI ) ratio was over 90 %, which we later learned should have disqualified us from receiving such a large loan. This raises serious concerns about FirstBank 's underwriting process and whether they knowingly approved a loan we could not afford. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, our original loan XXXX was terminated. We were assigned a new loan XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, who immediately questioned whether we could afford the loan and requested a pre-approval letter. A different mortgage company informed us that we only qualified for {$750000.00}, highlighting a significant discrepancy from the original approval. 
Despite following instructions to spend the remainder of the loan to determine how much we needed to complete the construction, the account was not funded until XX/XX/XXXX, even though we submitted receipts in XX/XX/XXXX. This delay caused severe financial strain and halted work with contractors. 
From XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, we were burdened with : - $ XXXX rent to American Homes XXXX XXXX $ XXXX to FirstBank, a $ XXXX to Cadence Bank, all while only bringing home $ XXXX in income. 
To stay afloat, we had to : - Sell {$28000.00} in employer stock, - Withdraw {$18000.00} from an IRA, - Take a {$10000.00} XXXX ( k ) loan, - Borrow {$160000.00} against XXXX investment property and {$150000.00} against another, - Max out XXXX credit cards ( {$45000.00} and {$27000.00} balances, respectively ). 
Our credit scores have dropped significantly ( mine from XXXX to XXXX ), and we've faced multiple loan denials ( car loan in XX/XX/XXXX, another loan in XX/XX/XXXX for my husband ). 
There is also a discrepancy on our credit report showing an incorrect FirstBank monthly payment of {$23000.00}, adding further damage to our financial standing.

2025-05-04,debt_collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"I am filing this formal complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), its shareholders, and XXXX, licensed property XXXX, XXXX XXXX, for engaging in deceptive billing practices, unlawful collection tactics, false statements, improper threats, and discriminatory actions that have unlawfully targeted me, my family and my real estate. These actions are a violation of several consumer protection laws and other laws designed to protect homeowners from unfair treatment. 

I have owned my property since XXXX, and since that time, I have consistently paid my XXXX dues in full. However, recent interactions with XXXX have raised significant concerns regarding their billing practices and their unlawful collection efforts. In a conversation with XXXX, the Vice President of XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was informed that I had a {$1500.00} credit balance. I requested that this credit be refunded to my original payment method, my XXXX card. XXXX told me that XXXX could not issue refunds to my card directly, but instead promised I would receive XXXX checks for {$170.00} and {$520.00}. To date, I have not received these checks. 

Following this conversation, XXXX began to engage in excessive and unexplained billing, which systematically depleted my {$1500.00} credit balance. This practice continued without my consent or a legitimate reason, as XXXX dues are paid once annually, and there should be no ongoing charges beyond the payment of these dues. This is a clear violation of federal law with prohibition of unfair and deceptive practices. 

Despite my repeated requests for detailed XXXX  statements, XXXX refused to provide me with the necessary documents. They failed to give any clear breakdown of my dues or charges, intentionally concealing material information. This refusal to provide transparency was not only misleading, but it also placed me at a disadvantage when trying to resolve the dispute. 

Furthermore, XXXX property management and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have a personal interest in my real estate investment property, they have real estate investors on the board ; which raises concerns about the intentions behind their actions. I suspect that they are attempting to unlawfully seize my property through deceptive and manipulative tactics. 

XXXX and its representatives, including XXXX, made false statements regarding my credit balance and the subsequent actions to be taken. XXXX claimed that I would receive XXXX checks as a refund for the credit balance on my account. This was a misrepresentation, as I never received these checks and instead found my account charged repeatedly with unexplained amounts. This is a classic example of false representation meant to mislead me and deprive me of my rights as a consumer. 

Additionally, XXXX licensed XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX, has also made misleading, hate charged statements and misrepresented the charges on my account, further contributing to the false impression that I owe funds when, in fact, I do not. These misrepresentations have directly harmed my ability to effectively dispute the charges and seek fair treatment. 

XXXX has repeatedly engaged in improper and unlawful communication with my property management company, XXXX, despite my clear instructions not to do so. XXXX explicitly told XXXX that I did not authorize them to handle XXXX-related matters and that all communications regarding my XXXX dues should be directed to me. Despite this instruction, XXXX continued to reach out to XXXX and requested that they make an additional payment of {$340.00} on my behalf, which is not only inappropriate but also a violation of my privacy and rights as the property owner. Moreover, XXXX  actions constitute a form of harassment, as they ignored the repeated requests to communicate directly with me. Instead, they chose to contact property management company XXXX in an attempt to bypass my authority and manipulate the situation to their advantage. 

In addition to the ongoing deception and improper communication, XXXX has threatened to take legal action against me and damage my credit. On multiple occasions, I was warned that XXXX would attempt to seize my property if I did not comply with their demands. XXXX has even reported false information through XXXX reporting and credit bureaus, which has negatively impacted my XXXX XXXX and defamed my character. These threats of legal action were not only unjustified but also a form of intimidation meant to coerce me into paying amounts that I do not owe. 

In XXXX disturbing instance, when I requested clarification regarding my credit balance, XXXX stated he passed my information along to shareholders to escalate the matter. This was a direct attempt to intimidate me into submitting to their unlawful billing practices. 

As a XXXX veteran and a property owner, I am entitled to clear disclosures and transparency in all dealings related to my real estate investments. Instead, XXXX has engaged in a pattern of deceitful and unlawful practices designed to strip me of my rights. Their failure to provide documentation, repeated harassment, and threats of legal action are all part of a broader scheme to unlawfully seize my property and unlawfully collect funds from me. 

Moreover, XXXX refusal to respond to my legitimate inquiries, including through the XXXX, CFPB, FTC and Attorney XXXX XXXX, further exacerbates the situation. In fact, XXXX has not only ignored my complaints in the past but also improperly contacted XXXX after being explicitly told not to, thus making false representations about the charges on my account. 

Finally, I want to reiterate that my property is not for sale, and I will not be coerced into selling or complying with unlawful demands. I have a legal right to own real estate as a XXXX American, XXXX Parent, And XXXX XXXX XXXX And Veteran, and no amount of harassment or deceit will force me to relinquish my property that I purchased using my VA loan after honorable service. 

I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau take immediate action to address these violations and ensure that XXXX is held accountable for their illegal and unethical practices. My family and I have suffered enough, and I trust that the CFPB will help bring a swift and fair resolution to this matter.

2025-06-10,debt_collection,Credit card debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"To Whom It May Concern, I am submitting this formal complaint regarding the continued inaccurate and harmful credit reporting by Possible Financial Inc, associated with account number ending in XXXX. The nature of this reporting appears to violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and potentially the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

Account Information : Creditor : Possible Financial Inc Account Type : Unsecured Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Original Balance : {$230.00} Reported Balance : {$270.00} Status : "" Account charged off. {$270.00} written off. {$270.00} past due as of XX/XX/XXXX '' Status Updated : XX/XX/XXXX Account Closed : Yes Payment Terms : 2 Months Negative History : 71 months Contact Info : Possible Financial Inc XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WA XXXX Phone : ( XXXX ) XXXX Key Issues with This Reporting : 1. Inaccurate and Misleading Past Due Status on Charged-Off Account The account was charged off yet is still reported as "" past due as of XX/XX/XXXX, '' which is inaccurate and violates FCRA 1681e ( b ). Charged-off debts are closed and can not simultaneously be past due. This misrepresentation falsely suggests continued delinquency and unfairly damages my credit. 

2. Ongoing Monthly Updates Constitute Illegal Re-Aging The last meaningful activity on this account was in XXXX, yet it continues to update monthly, appearing as a new delinquency. This extends the derogatory effect of the item well beyond the lawful seven-year limit outlined in FCRA 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ). Reporting this account as actively past due in XXXX could be construed as illegal re-aging, a prohibited practice under the law. 

3. Balance Inflation and Unexplained Fees The original balance on the account was {$230.00}. The reported charge-off balance is now {$270.00}. I have received no itemized explanation of how this {$40.00} increase occurred. Under FDCPA 808 ( 1 ), it is illegal to collect or report any amount unless it is expressly authorized by the agreement or permitted by law. I request a full validation of this amount. 

4. No Debt Validation Provided Despite Multiple Disputes I have contacted both Possible Financial and the credit bureaus multiple times, yet no validation of this debt has ever been provided. Under FDCPA 809 ( b ), if a consumer disputes a debt, the collector must cease collection and provide validation. To date, that has not happened, nor have I received any supporting documentation for this account. 

5. No 1099-C Cancellation of Debt Issued If Possible Financial has legally charged off this debt and has no intent to collect, they are obligated to issue a Form 1099-C under IRS Code 6050P. I have never received this form, and this inconsistency raises serious concerns about the accuracy and completeness of their reporting practices.

I contacted PHH several times during the forbearance period and the PHH representative cited they could not assist with taking any payments until I completed the forbearance- ( ORIGINAL FORBERANCE LETTER STATES THAT I COULD MAKE PARTIAL/FULL PAYMENT-DECEPTIVE ) and applied for mortgage assistance. I returned to work in XX/XX/XXXX and I was able to resume my previous monthly payments. I immediately completed the Mortgage Assistance Application in XX/XX/XXXX. From XX/XX/XXXX until the current date I have submitted all requested documents and most of the time it was duplicate documents that I had already submitted. I started to send all correspondence thru emails to ensure timely submission of documents and there was still a significant delay in processing my Mortgage Assistance application by PHH Mortgage. On XXXX XXXX ( ALMOST NINE MONTHS AFTER INITIAL REQUEST FOR MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE ) -PHH offered a loan Modification under the VA COVID 19 REFUND MODIFICATION The new terms were OUTRAGEOUS-my loan balance INCREASED, my interest rate INCREASED, my monthly payment INCREASED, and my Maturity date EXTENDED 5 YEARS- ( SEE PHH APPROVAL LETTER DATED XX/XX/XXXX XXXX.

After reviewing the VA Guidelines for the COVID-19 REFUND MODIFICATION offered by PHH. PHH failed to disclose other options that were available to me after my forbearance plan. I've enclosed the approval letter from PHH Mortgage citing I was approved for a loan modification under the VA COVID -19 REFUND MODIFICATION- ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ).

Shellpoint begins every customer calleven when the borrower is not in defaultwith the following statement : Newrez LLC dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing is a debt collector. This is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose. This blanket use of intimidating and legally charged language is psychologically coercive and unnecessary, especially for non-delinquent inquiries such as HELOC checks, balance inquiries, or account servicing issues. 

I have experienced emotional distress and repeated procedural abuse due to Shellpoint 's : - Failure to provide direct contact access to critical departments such as Second Liens. 
- Misinformation, contradictory timelines ( ranging from 2 to 30 days ), and repeated routing of calls with no resolution. 
- Misrouting of HELOC checks to the wrong address after lengthy delays. 
- False representation that after submitting initial documentation, I would be able to make online HELOC withdrawalswhen in fact I had to restart the entire process via physical mail. 
- Requirement to mail address update requests to a P.O. Box with no confirmation, tracking, or accountability : Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, SC XXXX. 
- Denial of all fee reversalseven when Shellpoint is at fault. 
- Service transfers from my original lender without my consent, trapping me with this abusive servicer for multiple loans. 

Each call to Shellpoint is a grueling, multi-hour ordeal that leaves me emotionally exhausted, stressed, and anxious. It affects my well-being and disrupts my life. These are not isolated incidentsthey are systemic, and they show a pattern of disregard for lawful, ethical servicing standards. 

I respectfully urge the FTC to : 1. Investigate Shellpoint for unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices under FDCPA, RESPA, and the FTC Act.

2. Require Shellpoint to modernize and audit its customer service practices.

3. Prohibit Shellpoint from using debt collection disclosures on non-collection calls.

4. Mandate Shellpoint to provide email and online alternatives for servicing requests. 
5. Impose penalties, and require financial restitution for consumers subjected to their practices. 

My loans were involuntarily transferred to Shellpoint, and I am now forced to endure their hostility across multiple accounts. I am not only requesting regulatory enforcement, but also financial restitution for the time, emotional damage, and procedural negligence I have suffered.

2025-05-30,mortgage,VA mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue with the application process,"Issue : Made multiple attempts to have former spouse ( XXXX ) removed from VA loan via VA assumption process and also as an unrestricted transfer of ownership. All attempts resulted in denials citing the same reason : that the divorce decree does not award the property to myself ( XXXX ). 

Some clarifying info : -VA loan opened in XXXX -Ex-spouse divorced and vacated property in XXXX -Quit Claim Deed signed by ex-spouse ( XXXX ) in XXXX, removing her interest in the property -Ex-spouse remarried in XXXX -Ex-spouse has been desiring to be removed from VA loan for some time now due to applying for her own mortgage ( this is complicating things for her ) -Divorce decree has myself as 100 % liable for mortgage payments and all payments have been made by me since inception of loan in XXXX -Divorce decree from XXXX does have an error where it doesn't clearly indicate property awarding to either party ( the 'Assets ' section has a "" XXXX ' next to 'Real Estate ' for both parties ). This was the reason XXXX signed a Quit Claim Deed in XXXX. 

Communication timeline with lender as follows : XX/XX/XXXX -- sent docs over to USAA / XXXX XXXX. Docs included divorce decree and a Quit Claim Deed signed by XXXX in XXXX removing her interest in the property in question. 

XX/XX/XXXX -- USAAXXXX XXXXXXXX denied my request citing the need for "" a copy of the decree to dissolve the marriage or legal separation agreement verifying the property was awarded to the Veteran ... '' XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX -- -contacted VA for guidance. After speaking with a VA rep, they stated that the denial reason by the lender isn't an issue with the VA but is a lender interpretation issue that they've heard happens all to often. The rep did recommend that if the lender is denying due to the divorce decree verbiage, that an unrestricted transfer request would also satisfy the intent to remove XXXX from the loan without the need for a divorce decree ( since it is not a VA assumption per their Circular resource ). 

XX/XX/XXXX -- -requested appeal of USAAXXXX XXXX XXXX to instead remove XXXX via unrestricted transfer of ownership per VA rep 's guidance. 

XX/XX/XXXX -- USAAXXXX XXXXXXXX denied by request citing same reason as before. 

XX/XX/XXXX -- requested another appeal for review with some clarifying info on the divorce decree. I also stated that I didn't feel they were reviewing my case accurately and felt that the lender was displaying UDAAP behavior ( Unfair, Deceptive, Abusive... etc. ) and that I was considering filing a CFPB complaint.

Note : This second appeal request did clarify that while the divorce decree did not award either person the property due to an error made in the XXXX filing, that a clear error was made. However, I specified several other items within the document that indicate the intent by myself and XXXX for the property to be awarded to me ( parenting plan indicates myself at this address, mortgage payment liability was awarded to me, furniture was awarded to me, etc. ). This is further validated by having a Quit Claim Deed signed by XXXX in XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX -- denied for same reason as before.

These accounts were opened without my knowledge or consent, and I believe they are fraudulent. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, I have the right to dispute inaccuracies in my credit report. Additionally, creditors are required to notify consumers of debt validation within five days of reporting such accounts. This was not done, which constitutes a clear violation of federal law. 

Violations Across All Bureaus : 1. Failure to Notify : Creditors must provide written notification of debts within five days, as required under 15 U.S.C. 1692g. This was not provided, making these accounts illegitimate. 
2. Failure to Ensure Accuracy : Under FCRA 607 ( b ), credit bureaus must ensure maximum accuracy in their reporting. Discrepancies in balances, high credit limits, open dates, and payment histories across bureaus indicate noncompliance. 
3. Failure to Investigate : Under FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), credit bureaus must investigate disputes within 30 days. My disputes remain unresolved despite exceeding the legally mandated timeline. 
4. Failure to Reinvestigate : FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) requires credit bureaus to reinvestigate if a consumer disputes the resolution of a claim. My disputes were not adequately addressed. 
5. Failure to Protect Personal Information : The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( 15 U.S.C. 6801-6809 ) requires financial institutions and credit bureaus to safeguard consumer data. This appears to have been compromised. 
6. Identity Theft Protections Ignored : The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act ( 18 U.S.C. 1028 ) criminalizes identity theft. These fraudulent accounts violate federal protections against identity theft. 
7. Failure to Provide Resources for Identity Theft Victims : Under FTC guidelines ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( e ) ), credit bureaus must provide victims of identity theft with resources and support, including fraud alerts. These steps were not implemented. 
8. State Law Violations : Under New Mexico Compiled Laws 445.65 to 445.67, identity theft is addressed as a criminal offense. These fraudulent accounts violate state law protections.

2025-05-16,credit_card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Credit card company won't increase or decrease your credit limit,"On XX/XX/year>, I received emails from Citi informing me that the credit limits on two of my accounts ( ending in XXXX and XXXX ) had been reduced. These reductions took effect immediately, on the same day I was notified. There was no advance warning or lawful notice provided, in apparent violation of the CARD Act, which requires issuers to notify cardholders 45 days in advance of changes that may negatively affect them. 

At the time of the reductions, both of my account balances were already below the new limits. However, this sudden change caused my utilization ratio to spike dramatically, damaging my credit profile. I had not missed any payments, exceeded my limits, or engaged in adverse usage behavior. 

I reviewed the Notices and Letters section of my Citi online account and confirmed that no prior notice was posted, mailed, or otherwise issued before the action was taken. On XX/XX/year>, two days after the reduction, Citi retroactively posted letters dated XX/XX/year>, after the damage had already occurred.

2025-04-16,debt_collection,Auto debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"Complaint : I am filing this complaint against NCB Management Services for inaccurately and unlawfully reporting a vehicle repossession collection on my credit report. This item is being reported with false dates and misleading information, and I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate and take appropriate enforcement action. 

Inaccuracies in Reporting : Incorrect Date of Repossession : NCB Management is reporting the date of the repossession offense as XX/XX/XXXX, but the actual date of repossession was XX/XX/XXXX. This manipulation of dates is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and appears to be an attempt to re-age the debt to keep it on my credit report longer than legally allowed. 

Improper Date of Last Activity : They are also reporting the date of last activity as XX/XX/XXXX, which is a future date and not possible. This appears to be either gross negligence or an intentional misrepresentation that violates the FCRA. 

No Authorization to Report : I have never entered into any agreement with NCB Management Services, nor have I authorized them to report to the credit bureaus on my behalf. I did not agree to pay them, and they have not provided validation of the debt or proof of their legal authority to collect or report it.

Violations of Federal Law : 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 : NCB is furnishing information that is knowingly inaccurate, which is a direct violation of 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ).

Re-aging a debt to manipulate the credit reporting timeline is unlawful and deceptive. 

Reporting a future date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) as the date of last activity violates 607 ( b ), which requires maximum possible accuracy in reporting.

2. FDCPA ( Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ) : By misrepresenting the date and legitimacy of the debt, NCB may also be in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1692e, which prohibits false, deceptive, or misleading representations in connection with the collection of a debt. 

Reporting information without validation or proper authorization can also be considered unfair and unconscionable conduct under XXXX.",,NCB Management Services Inc.,TX,77407,,Consent provided,Web,4/16/2025,Closed with explanation,Yes,,13028524,"complaint i am filing this complaint against ncb management services for inaccurately and unlawfully reporting a vehicle repossession collection on my credit report. this item is being reported with false dates and misleading information, and i am requesting that the consumer financial protection bureau investigate and take appropriate enforcement action. inaccuracies in reporting incorrect date of repossession ncb management is reporting the date of the repossession offense as xxxxxxxx, but the actual date of repossession was xxxxxxxx. this manipulation of dates is a violation of the fair credit reporting act fcra and appears to be an attempt to re-age the debt to keep it on my credit report longer than legally allowed. improper date of last activity they are also reporting the date of last activity as xxxxxxxx, which is a future date and not possible. this appears to be either gross negligence or an intentional misrepresentation that violates the fcra. no authorization to report i have never entered into any agreement with ncb management services, nor have i authorized them to report to the credit bureaus on my behalf. i did not agree to pay them, and they have not provided validation of the debt or proof of their legal authority to collect or report it. violations of federal law 1. fair credit reporting act fcra 15 u.s. code 1681s-2 ncb is furnishing information that is knowingly inaccurate, which is a direct violation of 623 a 1 a . re-aging a debt to manipulate the credit reporting timeline is unlawful and deceptive. reporting a future date xxxxxxxx as the date of last activity violates 607 b , which requires maximum possible accuracy in reporting. 2. fdcpa fair debt collection practices act by misrepresenting the date and legitimacy of the debt, ncb may also be in violation of 15 u.s. code 1692e, which prohibits false, deceptive, or misleading representations in connection with the collection of a debt. reporting information without validation or proper authorization can also be considered unfair and unconscionable conduct under xxxx.",2025-04,334

There was some kind of intricate scam going on at this time involving my credit card ending in XXXX. On XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, and XX/XX/year>, I had received 3 separate deliveries from my local XXXX store. Each package contained a bag of balloons that I had not ordered. I was especially concerned about this because my name was clearly on each package as though I ordered it. I called XXXX 's customer service and the rep looked up my XXXX account and informed me that there were no such charges on my account. He could not explain why I received the packages and told me not to worry about it because no such orders were on my account.

During this same time, ( not sure if this had anything to do with the above ) I received XXXX small yellow packages from an unknown sender on different days. I only opened the first received package which was a letter that was very vague thanking me for a purchase but not indicating what the purchase was or from whom. I knew it was another scam and assumed it was connected to the XXXX balloons somehow. I think this scammer was hoping I would scan the "" QR '' code on the front of the package to try to figure out who it was from but I declined to do that to avoid going deeper into their scam.

2025-06-13,debt_collection,Other debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Seized or attempted to seize your property,"I am filing this complaint because Steel River Systems , LLC made threatening statements regarding legal action in connection with a debt I do not owe and have disputed. 

My previous CFPB complaint focused on these threats. Steel River responded by providing a basic debt verification letter, but completely ignored the allegation of threatening legal action which was the primary issue. They never denied it, addressed it, or justified their behavior. The CFPB then marked the case as closed despite this key issue being left unresolved. 

The alleged debt originated from a fraudulent check that XXXX XXXX XXXX accepted and processed in XXXX. XXXX later charged off and closed the account, and I believe they likely recovered the funds through insurance or internal procedures. At no point was I held legally responsible by XXXX. 

Years later, Steel River Systems is claiming ownership of this alleged debt despite : No proof of ownership or assignment from XXXX No documentation showing the debt is valid, collectible, or lawfully transferred And most importantly, they made threats of legal action in their phone communication with me.

2025-04-05,debt_collection,Credit card debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Sued you in a state where you do not live or did not sign for the debt,"My name is XXXX XXXX, and I am filing this complaint regarding Portfolio Recovery Associates ( PRA ) for what I believe are unlawful and deceptive debt collection practices, including initiating a lawsuit in a state where I do not reside, and attempting to collect a debt without valid legal standing. 
1. PRA Filed a Lawsuit in a State I Do Not Live In PRA has filed a lawsuit against me in the state of XXXX, despite the fact that I am a resident of Minnesota and have been for an extended period. My current and correct address is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX I have not lived in XXXX  in years, and PRAs attempt to file in a state where I do not reside violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), which requires legal actions to be filed in the proper venue, either where the contract was signed or where the consumer currently lives. I do not live in GA. 
2. Debt Origination and PRAs Claim of Assignment from XXXX The alleged debt originally stemmed from XXXX XXXX, not from Portfolio Recovery Associates. XXXX is not suing me, nor have they communicated any active collection efforts. 
PRA claims to be the assignee of the debt from XXXX. However, XXXX has removed this debt from my credit report, which suggests they no longer consider the account active or valid. This raises a serious question : If XXXX no longer claims this debt, on what legal basis is PRA attempting to collect it? 
Additionally, XXXX has my current address on file because I have sent multiple dispute letters to them from the address in XXXX, and I have received responses there. If PRA was legitimately acting on XXXX behalf, they would have had this correct information. 

3. No Communication or Agreement with PRA I have had no communication with PRA no letters, no phone calls, no agreements, and no acknowledgments of this debt on my part. I have never agreed to repay this debt to PRA, nor have I received any documentation or notices from them at my XXXX  residence. 
Instead, they filed suit using my mothers address in Georgia, where I do not reside. I may have visited, but I have not lived there in years. Again, this is a clear indication of their intent to mislead or gain a legal advantage by filing in an improper venue. 

4. Concerns of Fraudulent or Deceptive Collection Practices All of this leads me to believe that Portfolio Recovery Associates is engaging in deceptive and potentially fraudulent debt collection practices : They sued in the wrong state. 


They claim to represent XXXX, despite XXXX appearing to have relinquished any claim to the debt. 


They used an address to serve papers that I do not live at and haven't for years, despite XXXX having my current address. 


They have never communicated with me or given me the opportunity to validate or dispute the debt. 


PRA is well-known for aggressive and questionable debt collection tactics, including lawsuits without proper documentation or standing. 


Request for Investigation I am requesting that the CFPB investigate Portfolio Recovery Associates for : Violating the FDCPA and other relevant consumer protection laws, Engaging in potentially fraudulent lawsuits, Attempting to collect on a debt without proper documentation or authorization, Suing in a jurisdiction where I do not reside, and Failing to notify or communicate with me through proper channels. 


I also request that this debt be invalidated and that any lawsuit initiated by PRA be immediately dismissed due to improper venue and lack of standing. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me know if you need any supporting documentation, including the dispute letters I sent to XXXX and any court papers received from PRA.

I am filing this complaint regarding my Wells Fargo account ending in XXXX, which currently reports multiple late payment marks. These occurred during a period when I was facing serious financial hardship due to circumstances beyond my control. I contacted Wells Fargo and requested a goodwill removal, but they refused, stating they only remove late marks if there is a reporting error. I believe this is unfair and punitive. 

These marks are now outdated and do not reflect my current financial situation, which is stable and improving. I am working hard to rebuild my credit and maintain strong financial habits. The continued presence of these negative marks is preventing me from accessing credit opportunities, despite the fact that Ive demonstrated long-term responsible behavior since.

While the late payments may be technically accurate, the context of verified hardship, subsequent good-standing, and lack of willful negligence should warrant reconsideration. Many financial institutions grant goodwill removals in similar cases.

2025-05-16,mortgage,VA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"Ignoring a Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) carries significant legal ramifications for the mortgage servicer, in our case, with XXXX  XXXX XXXX and Shell Point Mortgage Servicing Company. These issues stem from the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) and its implementing regulations ( Regulation X ). This is our breakdown of the legal issues given to us from the XXXX XXXX XXXX monorator XXXX XXXX who drafted our QWR format 1. Violation of RESPA : * Statutory Duty to Respond : RESPA Section 6 ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ) and Regulation X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 and 1024.36 ) clearly outline the servicer 's obligations upon receiving a QWR. These include acknowledging receipt within five business days and providing a substantive response within 30 business days ( with a possible 15-day extension under specific conditions ). Ignoring the QWR outright is a direct violation of these statutory requirements.

2. Potential for Monetary Penalties and Damages : * Actual Damages : Borrowers who suffer actual harm due to the servicer 's failure to respond to a QWR can sue for damages. This could include financial losses incurred because of the unanswered inquiry, expenses related to trying to resolve the issue, and potentially even damages for emotional distress if directly caused by the servicer 's inaction.

* Statutory Damages : In cases where a pattern or practice of RESPA violations is evident, courts can award statutory damages up to {$2000.00} per violation. While a single instance of ignoring a QWR might not automatically trigger statutory damages, it could contribute to a finding of a pattern or practice if other similar violations occur.

* Costs and Attorney 's Fees : If a borrower is forced to file a lawsuit to compel the servicer to respond to the QWR or to seek damages for the non-response and is successful, the court may order the servicer to pay the borrower 's legal costs and attorney 's fees.

3. Regulatory Scrutiny and Enforcement Actions : * Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Enforcement : The CFPB is the primary federal agency responsible for enforcing RESPA. Ignoring a QWR can lead to borrowers filing complaints with the CFPB. If the CFPB finds a pattern of non-compliance or significant harm to consumers, it can initiate investigations, issue fines, and take other enforcement actions against the servicer. 
* State Regulatory Actions : State attorneys general and banking regulators also have consumer protection authority and may take action against servicers that violate RESPA or similar state laws. 
4. Legal Challenges in Foreclosure Proceedings : * Defense to Foreclosure : In your specific situation involving a foreclosure, the failure of XXXX  XXXX XXXX to honor your QWR, particularly one requesting information relevant to the foreclosure process or the validity of the debt, could potentially be used as a defense against the foreclosure. You could argue that the bank failed to provide necessary information that might have helped you understand or challenge the foreclosure. 
* Grounds for Injunction : A court might be willing to issue an injunction to halt or delay foreclosure proceedings until the bank properly responds to the QWR, especially if the information requested is crucial to understanding your rights and options. 
XXXX. Negative Publicity and Reputational Damage : * While not a direct legal issue in terms of monetary penalties, ignoring customer inquiries and legal obligations like QWR responses can lead to negative publicity and damage the servicer 's reputation, potentially impacting their business in the long run. 
In summary, ignoring a QWR is a legally risky action for a mortgage servicer. It can lead to financial liability through lawsuits, regulatory penalties, and potential complications in foreclosure proceedings. It's crucial for servicers to have processes in place to promptly and thoroughly address all QWRs they receive.

The night we were moving in, the downstairs neighbor ( who later admitted and apologized to me for their actions ) called in a noise complaint to the management and the police. As we were not violating quiet hours and were not making noise beyond simply moving into our new home, we didn't think much of it. My kids have two dogs, so they were instructed to walk the dogs when they got home from school. The management began sending me daily emails about my children 's misbehavior with picking up after the dogs. I knew they were, so I had my children begin taking pictures of dog waste in bags, yet the threats from management persisted for what I assume was retribution for the first complaint we had received. I finally had enough of the management 's malicious behavior against my children so I suggested that we part ways, and they agreed to end the lease so long as we had the residence professionally cleaned and would be out by the end of XXXX. We complied with the agreement. The management then continued to charge me, charged me in court with an eviction for a property I no longer resided in, and tried to enforce fines on me that I was not able to defend myself against because I did not know about them. 

They then rushed to pass off the debt to this collector ( Fair Collections and Outsourcing ) under two amounts. The collector called and asked what was owed, and I stated that I had paid XXXX, paid for the cleaning service that the management had said I needed to pay for, and repeatedly told management that I was leaving the mailbox key ( the door locks operated on a smart system controlled by management ) in the kitchen and left. They informed me that management was asking for over {$6000.00}. I told them I wanted a Statement detailing these charges. They agreed to send me one. I told them that I would email them ( which I did ) a receipt for the cleaners and emails from management confirming my testimony and asked for a receipt of that documentation.

XX/XX/XXXX : I opened my Marcus by Goldman Sachs HYSA with no initial problems. 
XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX  ) : I encountered difficulties transferring money to and from my account. Upon contacting customer support, I was informed that transfers might take a few days. When attempting to verify my identity via a phone verification code, the system failed to recognize my number. As a result, I was required to wait for an affidavit of identity letter, which took 3-5 days to arrive. 
Following Weeks : The initial transfer was ultimately placed back into my HYSA, eliminating the need for the affidavit letter. However, in XXXX, I encountered further difficulties withdrawing funds. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I called customer support again to request a new affidavit letter, as I had discarded the previous one. I was told it would take 3-10 days to arrive. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I called to check the status and inquired whether I could submit a PDF version of the affidavit of identity letter available on Marcus by Goldman Sachs website since it was taking longer to arrive at my residence. My request was denied, and I was told to wait for the mailed version. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Frustrated due to ongoing account access issues, I called customer support twice. The first representative ended the call after stating someone would call me back. The second time, I requested a supervisor, who escalated my case. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I called again, concerned that my affidavit request had not been submitted. I requested immediate confirmation with another supervisor. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I called again checking status, and I was informed that my affidavit letter had been shipped and would arrive soon. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I received a call and an email from Marcus by Goldman Sachs indicating that action was required on my account. I also received the affidavit letter in the mail that day and immediately contacted Marcus to inform them of its receipt.

2025-06-05,credit_card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"I already filed complaint XXXX. 

That complaint was closed, but not resolved. Citibank is continuing to treat me with hostility and refusing to address the issue. 

My account has a fraud notice that they added, as they've repeatedly added fraud alerts to only my Citibank Premier Card ( I have other citi cards that they don't treat this way ), yet they continue to charge me an Annual Fee for a card they won't let me use or cancel. 

Citibank issued a reference number by postal mail and voice mail. I am sorry I do not work for citibank and can not contact them on whatever schedule they may have due to my busy travel schedule. I called them at the earliest possible and they rejected the reference number they provided me. They told me it's not valid and that is the extent of assistance I was given. 

The agent refused to assist me. The agent refused to tell me if a new letter has been generated and sent to me with a new reference number. The agent refused to issue a new letter with a new reference number. The agent refused any possible way to resolve the issue. The agent refused to offer any sort of solution with a given timeline where I could hope to resolve the issue. The agent told me she is helping me by telling me to just wait and do nothing. I asked to speak with the agent 's manager or supervisor and the agent refused. There is no way to escalate this issue except via another CFPB complaint. 

In the response to my previous complaint, Citibank suggested I edit and update my contact information on my account. This is another insult and sign of Citibank 's complete incompetence since they should know full well you can not modify the address on a card with a fraud alert on it without first resolving the fraud alert. Citibank never fails to miss an opportunity to demonstrate their incompetence while treating their customers with hostility. 

How can I get this issue resolved if Citibank refuses to provide any way to resolve the fraud alert and there is no way to remove it?

2025-06-12,savings,Checking account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"Hello, On XX/XX/year>, I attempted two legitimate fund transfers from my checking account with Citibank to trading platform Coinbase for investment of that portion of the retirement fund I had recently withdrawn from Empower Financial. The path for these funds from XXXX, through my XXXX account that was tied to the retirement fund, is easily verifiable, as I mentioned to Citibanks customer service teams on a number of occasions. XXXX is a legitimate, fintech company that operates in compliance with all pertinent United States regulations, as well as those of international markets. The transaction process complied with all bank regulations. 

Yet, without prior notice or clear explanation, Citibank froze my bank accounts on XX/XX/year> causing me great inconveniences, including : Inability to access legitimate funds in the account on the order of {$76000.00}, Inability to make needed bill payments and financial arrangements, Credit history may be negatively affected. 

On the morning of the XXXX, I called Citibank, because I had noticed my funds had not reached XXXX, and my Citibank online profile was inactive, instructing me to call the number on the back of my debit card. I did so, and I was informed that my account had been closed, and I was transferred to their Fraud department. It was then I learned that not only were my accounts frozen but my {$75000.00} in transfers and {$1000.00} in checking balance and been seized. I was told the transfers were under review, and that I would be receiving a letter explaining why the funds were seized, and what the recovery process would entail and how the matter would be resolved. I was also informed that I would not be refunded my money for another XXXX days. I later received an email that day from Citibank stating the same. My XXXX  called the company customer service line later with other questions, but she was told there was nothing more they could offer, that they would be able to answer some of her questions on the following day. When we called the following day, they again stated we would not get any explanation until we received the letter in 10 days.

Waiting for the letter until after the XXXX XXXX weekend, on the XXXX, we received no letter. When I called the customer service line again on the morning of the XXXX, I was again directed to their Fraud team, who informed me that the refund, if any, would come in XXXX  days from then, but no letter would come before that. They told me I should expect to receive the explanatory letter along with any funds they deemed were due me at the end of the XXXX period. 

After some additional research into this form of treatment to which Citibank has subjected other customers recently, I found that I should appeal to Citibanks Citi Executive Response Unit. On XX/XX/year>, I sent my appeal to the CERU stating the details of the matter and my account specifics. I received a confirmation of the receipt of that email later that day. In my email, I stated I would file a complaint with CFPB by XXXXXXXX were no response from Citibank forthcoming. XXXX, XX/XX/year>, I received another email from Citibank stating that my closed accounts ( checking and savings ) will automatically close within XXXX  days ; there is no statement regarding why the accounts were closed other than the terms of the account per the client manual were violated, but they do not specify how, and I was ensured every use of my account was within guidelines at the time the mobile app and online site are very explicit with each action performed what is proper.

So, now I am filing this complaint with your bureau regarding Citibanks seizure of {$76000.00} of mine.

2025-06-12,savings,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"Subject : URGENT CFPB Complaint Arvest Bank Data Breach, Fraudulent Charges, and Unfair Denial of Dispute Im filing this complaint because Arvest Bank is refusing to refund fraudulent charges that occurred immediately after they exposed my full debit card number and personal information in a data breach, a breach they admitted to in writing. 

On XX/XX/scrub>, 2025, I received a Notice of Data Breach letter from Arvest stating that my full debit card number, first name, and last name were sent in error to another customer by email. That customer admitted to receiving it, deleted the email, and was even asked by Arvest to sign an affidavit of deletion. So, Arvest knows and admits that my card was compromised through no fault of my own.

The letter stated : An internal report containing your debit card information was attached in error to an email sent to one customer.

Were providing IDProtect coverage Well also be closely monitoring these cards for fraudulent activity.

If you see suspicious activity, reach out to us immediately.

As a result of this incident, we are offering you identity theft recovery services at no charge for one year. 

Shortly after that breach on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX there were unauthorized charges made in Arkansas, where I was not located. I immediately contacted Arvest, filed a dispute, and later filed a new dispute with only the charges that match the breach. Despite this, Arvest is trying to deny my dispute, claiming I filed it too late. But this timeline proves otherwise : Fraudulent Charges Tied to Breach : XXXX XXXXXXXX {$91.00} Monday, XX/XX/year>2025 XXXX {$92.00} Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2025 XXXX XXXX XXXX {$79.00} Tuesday, XX/XX/scrub>, 2025 XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  {$10.00} Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, 2025 XXXX XXXX XXXX  {$31.00} Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, 2025 XXXX XXXX XXXX  {$77.00} Tuesday, XX/XX/year>2025 XXXX XXXX  {$320.00} Friday, XX/XX/year>2025 These charges match the exact days surrounding the known breach, before I even received the letter in the mail. I had no prior way to know my card had been compromised until Arvest told me. And now they are blaming me for the delay, when they acknowledged responsibility in writing and offered identity monitoring for one year.

Even worse, Ive spoken to six different Arvest representatives, and no one will take responsibility, even as theyre referencing a subscription charge I never authorized to try and justify denying my dispute.

I am asking the CFPB to hold Arvest accountable and ensure that I receive a full refund for the above fraudulent charges, My dispute is accepted and honored, especially given the documented breach, Arvest follows the law under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( Regulation E ), Arvest provides clear and transparent reasoning for how they are handling this situation which right now seems designed to avoid responsibility for their admitted error.

This experience has caused me enormous stress. Arvest is trying to deflect responsibility even though they themselves caused the breach. I deserve my money back.

2025-06-11,credit_card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I signed up with the security provider, XXXX, a few months back after a roaming salesperson approached me at my home. I had been in the market for a security system so, the timing was right. The salesperson told me that they were going door-to-door in our area and if we had agreed to post their sign in our yard, XXXX would provide the equipment for FREE and that I would only be responsible for the {$89.00} monitoring fee with them. I have paid this amount regularly with only a short lapse when my debit card expired XX/XX/XXXX. Once I received my new debit card, I immediately added it to my XXXX app so payments could continue. 

Fast forward a couple of months and I started receiving calls from a number I did not recognize almost daily or sometimes multiple times daily. I am not always in a position to answer the phone during the working day but, when I finally answered, I was told that I owed {$290.00} to a financing company called XXXX, whom opened a retail credit card, charged to {$4000.00} for the equipment I was told was free. I did not want another line of credit nor did I consent to financing. Had that been the deal, I would have outright refused the offer and located a different security company.

I have since tried contacting them to resolve this issue and to completely close whatever it was I was signed up. Each time Ive spoken with a representative, I was asked for either a ) my account number, which I do not have or b ) the last 4-digits of my Social Security Number. When I verify the last 4-digits of my Social Security Number, I am told that the number they have on file DOES NOT match. I spoke with a representative from XXXX  today, XX/XX/XXXX, and when I attempted to confirm the last 4-digits of my Social Security Number I was again told it DOES NOT match. The representative then asked me to scan or send a copy of my Social Security Card, which I outright denied. The representative then gave me a separate number to call to try and resolve or dispute. When I called that number, I was met with an automated prompt that asked, again, for either the last 4-digits of my Social Security Number OR my account number, which is completely unknown to me. At this point, XXXX  has also claimed to have placed a statement credit in the amount of {$190.00} however, they are still attempting to bill me that same amount PLUS additional late fees. As a result, my credit rating is taking a hit do a delinquent account that I can not access or was completely unknown to me. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email notice that I had scheduled a payment of {$200.00}, which was also not authorized nor did I consent to autopay terms with XXXX. I expressly told them NO, that I did not consent to them utilizing my debit card for automatic payment, especially since I had no idea who they were or what was going on. My account was NOT debited in the amount of {$200.00} thankfully but apparently tacked on a bunch of late fees. Had it been true that they credited me {$190.00}, I would then, in theory have owed {$10.00} if this were an honest transaction - NOT {$300.00}, which is inclusive of the allegedly scheduled {$200.00} + late fees incurred. 

I utilize XXXX for additional monitoring and services and, after receiving a recent notice of delinquency alert from XXXX today, XX/XX/XXXX, I reviewed the notice and found that XXXX  had marked my account open and CLOSED multiple times as well as delinquent. 

I spoke with XXXX today, XX/XX/XXXX, and they were able to provide my XXXX  account number. XXXX, however, keeps giving me scripted responses and or is unable to help me because they cant find my account or verify it!

Their failure to protect my funds and their subsequent denial of my claim raise concerns about their fraud prevention protocols and consumer protection policies. As a banking customer, I expect due diligence and responsible financial practices from institutions entrusted with safeguarding my assets.

I am reaching out to seek your assistance with a troubling issue involving Prosper Credit Card, which has significantly impacted my financial peace of mind. I am hoping for your guidance in pursuing further legal action to resolve this matter. 

Recently, I discovered three unauthorized transactions on my Prosper Credit Card account, totaling {$640.00}. The charges were as follows : {$340.00}, {$270.00}, and {$22.00}. Upon noticing these discrepancies, I immediately contacted Prosper Credit Card to report the issue, request a replacement card with different numbers, and initiate an investigation into the transactions. The representative assured me that a dispute had been opened and that I would receive a temporary credit while the situation was being investigated. 

However, it has now been over a month since my initial contact, and I have not received any meaningful updates regarding the status of the investigation. To make matters worse, when I called again to follow up, a different representative provided conflicting information about my case. This inconsistency in communication has heightened my concerns about the security of my account and the company 's commitment to resolving the issue. 

Given these circumstances, I am seeking legal assistance as I feel that Prosper Credit Card has failed to manage this situation appropriately and has not upheld its responsibility to protect its customers. I believe that taking legal action may be necessary to expedite a resolution and ensure that my rights as a consumer are safeguarded.

However, the routing number turned out to be an ACH number, and the wire transfer failed. This prompted multiple fraud alerts from XXXX XXXX, requiring me to make two separate visits to XXXX and speak with three representatives to clear the issue. 

Due to this inconvenience, I decided to physically withdraw the {$10000.00} from XXXX and deliver it directly to the same Bank of America branch in XXXX XXXX. When I arrived, I presented XXXX forms of ID, along with the {$10000.00}, which was secured in a Chase money bag. The teller accepted the deposit, and I received a printed receipt for the transaction. 

At that point, XXXX XXXX, another Bank of America relationship banker, invited me to his office to help me add the business debit card to my XXXX XXXX. However, when I attempted to log into the Bank of America mobile app, I discovered that my account had been locked. XXXX called Bank of America support, then handed me the phone. I spoke to a representative who identified himself only as XXXX. 

This individual informed me that my account had been closed and refused to provide a reason, stating that he was under no obligation to explain. His tone was aggressive, condescending, and unprofessional. I recorded the conversation and have it available for your review. The call occurred less than XXXX minutes after I had deposited {$10000.00} in cash into the account. 

When I asked to have my funds returned, I was told that a request would have to be submitted and it would take XXXX business days to return my money which I find deeply unacceptable given that they had just received my deposit. 

I also expressed that I believed the treatment I received was racially motivated, as I had been treated with suspicion and disregard without explanation or transparency. My concerns were ignored by the staff. I was treated disrespectfully and dismissed without cause, and the bank offered no justification for the closure of my business account or the retention of my funds. 

This experience has been XXXX, offensive, and disruptive to my operations as a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am requesting the following : A full investigation into the discriminatory handling of my account. 
Immediate release and return of my funds in full. 
A written explanation for the closure of my account.

2025-06-07,savings,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"On XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX I made a purchase using my USAA debit card from an online store called XXXX for {$190.00}. The website appeared trustworthy at the time of purchase, and I placed the order for multiple items. 

Shortly after placing the order, I discovered concerning reviews indicating the company was possibly fraudulent. I immediately contacted the seller and successfully canceled part of my order. On XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX the merchant responded via email, confirmed the cancellation, and promised a partial refund of {$99.00} within 7 business days. 

The refund was never processed. Part of the order that was eventually shipped was completely different from what was advertised. The remaining high-value item ( the bean bags ) was marked as delivered, but tracking information shows that it was delivered to a completely different state, not to my address. I never received this shipment. 

After multiple attempts to contact the merchant, they stopped responding, shut down their website, and later rebranded under a new name using the same product images, pricing, and sales tactics to continue the same fraudulent operation. This is part of a deliberate and ongoing scam targeting online consumers. 

I submitted a debit card dispute with USAA, providing all documentation : the merchants written refund confirmation, proof of misdelivery to another state, photos of the incorrect item received, and evidence of the merchant shutting down and rebranding under a new fraudulent store. Despite submitting all this clear and detailed evidence, USAA denied my dispute. 

This complaint is not only about the money but about protecting consumers who have acted in good faith. As a military veteran and loyal USAA customer for over 11 years, I expected my bank which publicly states its mission is to "" facilitate the financial security of its members, associates, and their families through the provision of a full range of highly competitive financial products and services '' to provide proper consumer protection, especially against clear and documented fraud. 

Regardless of the outcome, I am extremely disappointed that USAA, an institution founded to serve and protect military members and their families, failed to stand by its own stated mission. As a loyal member for over 11 years and a XXXX veteran, I trusted USAA to protect me against this clear fraud. The fact that I am forced to escalate this matter to regulators to seek basic consumer protection is deeply concerning.

Following the theft, over {$4000.00} in unauthorized transactions were made using my stolen card and PIN, including numerous ATM withdrawals and cash-back purchases across several days. The claim number with Wells Fargo is # XXXX. 

I did not authorize any of these transactions, and I immediately reported the theft and the fraudulent activity to Wells Fargo. However, despite clearly being the victim of criminal fraud, Wells Fargo denied my claim, citing that the correct PIN was used as if that makes the activity authorized. This is a misapplication of the law and a direct violation of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), 15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq., and Regulation E ( 12 CFR 1005 ). 

Under 15 U.S.C. 1693g, I am not liable for unauthorized transactions if I report them in a timely manner, especially when the access device ( my debit card ) was used without my authorization. The use of the correct PIN by a thief does not constitute my consent to the transfers. 

Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 1693f, Wells Fargo had a legal duty to promptly investigate my claim, provide provisional credit, and resolve the matter fairly they failed on all counts. Instead, they dismissed the case without considering the full facts, including : Multiple ATM withdrawals made at the same two XXXX locations over several days. 
Suspiciously maxed-out withdrawal amounts in short intervals.

We were also never told that reapplying could jeopardize our {$3000.00} earnest money.

USAA just informed me that my children were removed from XXXX policy to be added to mine but refuses to provide any information since we have been separated in XXXX divorce court since XXXX. 
Until today, USAA claimed that they could not add my daughters to my account, even though they drive my vehicles and reside in my household.

Inability to Access or Share Information : USAA refuses to share any information from XXXX account with me, even though we are legally married.

There has been no formal declaration of divorce in our household.

USAAs records do not reflect any marital change, yet they altered the policy under XXXX account without my knowledge or consent. 

Lack of Documentation and Communication : Previous conversations with USAA regarding our marital status and coverage details have not been recorded in their system. 
USAA states they can not look into anyone elses account but continue to make changes that affect my policy and coverage based on XXXX account. 

Insurance Coverage for My Children : I was just told after speaking with USAA many times in the past about index number XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX Date Action Commenced that I would need to be transferred to a separation or divorce team for further assistance suddenly. 

Billing and Renewal Concerns : My auto insurance policy is scheduled to renew on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I will receive a prorated bill of {$780.00} in XXXX and {$780.00} in XXXX. 
I was informed I have six months to pay the premium, but the renewal cost may increase, now that USAA is allowing me to add my children to my auto insurance policy.. 



Request for Assistance : This mishandling has left me unsure of my childrens coverage status and vulnerable to financial liability. I request that the CFPB investigate the following : Why USAA refuses to recognize or document my attempts to clarify coverage and household membership.

Why changes were made under my spouses policy without mutual consent or communication.

Why my children were not being added to my auto policy despite living in my household and driving my vehicles.

I am concerned about the lack of transparency, accountability, and customer service from USAA regarding these matters. I request assistance in resolving this dispute and ensuring that my children are properly covered under my auto insurance policy. 



I am happy to provide ing records and correspondence for reference. Proof of insurance should be sent to XXXX as previously requested from USAA.

While the charge was initially authorized, I filed a dispute on XX/XX/XXXX, after learning the attorney was disbarred, never provided any billing records, and failed to deliver the services promised. The signed agreement required monthly billing, and I made multiple documented requests for an accounting of how my retainer was used. The merchant never provided any billing statement, invoice, or breakdown of charges. No policy stating the retainer was non-refundable was disclosed at the time of payment. After the dispute was submitted, the merchant attempted to retroactively declare the retainer non-refundable through a letter I never received by mail which also contained a crossed-out date and lacked any confirmed delivery. 

Citi opened the dispute, issued a provisional credit, and formally requested documentation from me, which I promptly provided including the signed contract, written statement, and supporting communications. After accepting and processing the dispute in full, Citi later reversed the credit, claiming the dispute was not timely. This reversal came without any documentation from the merchant, and without giving me an opportunity to respond or appeal. At no point did Citi indicate that a rebuttal had been submitted or reviewed.

2025-06-06,credit_card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"On XX/XX/year> I was approached by XXXX individuals in front of a XXXX XXXX  at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. XXXX of the individuals explained that his XXXX  had recently been XXXX  and he was asking for donations to help pay the XXXX  costs. I learned later that this is a common deceptive practice. The man and the other younger boys were wearing badges on lanyards ( which were apparently fake ) that indicated their fund raising was authorized by the XXXX of XXXX, the XXXX of XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX. He explained that he was only allowed to collect donations via credit card and asked me if I could donate {$5.00}. I agreed to donate {$5.00}. He entered {$5.00} into a handheld device, showed it to me his phone, which had a credit card scanner attached to it. I tapped my previous ( now cancelled ) card on the scanner after he showed me the amount {$5.00} on the screen. The XXXX younger men then attempted to distract me, and I looked away while the man apparently changed {$5.00} to {$5000.00} and attempted to process the charge more than once. XXXX of the boys had handed me a clipboard that showed a list of the other people who had supposedly donated and a pen that was not working. While trying to sign the document on the clipboard, the other older boy grabbed my phone from my hand and held it momentarily. It was in that moment that he was able to respond "" yes '' to a text from CitiBank. My phone then died when I took it back as it was very low on charge. The XXXX of them then hurried away down the sidewalk. I knew I was the vicitim of a crime. 

I suspected immediately that I was the victim of a credit card fraud or deceptive practices crime. But my phone was now off and needed a few minutes to recharge. 

When my phone was sufficiently charged ( about XXXX minutes later ) I received a call from the Citibank XXXX XXXX department. I spoke with someone ( did not get a name ) who told me that they recognized the charge as suspicious/fraudulent charge, that it would be declined, and I told that person that I never authorized any charges of {$5000.00} to XXXX  * XXXX XXXX XXXX I was assured by the Citibank representative would be declined and removed from my account. And, confidently, that I did not need to worry because my account was protected by Citicard XXXX XXXX. Since then I have spoken with several other Citicard and Citi XXXX XXXX department who have all assured me that I would not be responsible for the charges, which were entered as {$5000.00}, not the {$5.00} I agreed to donate for the XXXX  's XXXX  costs. 

What I find to be CitiBank 's fault is that after recognizing the first {$5000.00} as fraudulent and declining the charge, and recommending I immediately cancel the card, which I did within a few minutes of the fraudulent transaction ( s ), Citi then processed XXXX more identical charges and transferred them to a new account they setup for me after cancelling the card that was used at the time of the incident. In their most recent letter they mentioned that the XXXX  and XXXX  charges were processed by them during a period of "" security closure '' clearance, which was after the first charge was declined by CitiCard, and after the card presented at the time of the incident was cancelled. I received no notification from Citi of the XXXX and XXXX charges, but they themselves recognized the XXXX  charge of {$5000.00} was fraudulent and declined it. 

I have sent them numerous documents and have also engaged an attorney, XXXX XXXX to help me resolve this matter. I can provide all the documents to CFPB at your request. 

After CitiCard received the first communication from my attorney, which advised Citi to not contact me directly, they did call me directly anyway. 

Also, after the incident on XX/XX/XXXX, I had numerous calls and spoke with several representatives from CitiBank, who all told me I would not be held responsible for any of the XXXX {$5000.00} charges from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX on the afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have provided CFPB with several of the documents submitted as evidence that this was deceptive criminal practices, and that the first charge was declined by me on the phone and subsequently by CitiCards, within a few minutes of the incident, as I was in direct contact and received in person assistance from a Citicard representatives. 

At a different time I spoke with XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) at the Citi XXXX fraud team ( US phone number XXXX ). On that call and several others, CitiBank representatives told me that I would not be held be responsible for these charges. My credit card statement and written correspondence, received much later, confirm a different message. 

CitiCard continues to restate that since I was "" scammed '' it was not a fraudulent charge, and that since I provided my card ( for a {$5.00} payment ) I am responsible for XXXX charges of {$5000.00}, the XXXX  of which CitiCards themselves recognized as fraudulent, and knew to decline. They called me minutes after the incident occured ( incoming phone record provided in attachments )- so CitiCards clearly recognized the XXXX  charge was fraudulent/suspicious activity. The XXXX  and XXXX  charges were processed by CitiCard with no notification or authorization by me, and after the card had been cancelled. Citi continues to assert that I approved the charges because I presented my credit card. This is puzzling ; I present my credit card at every in person transaction, but if any other store or vendor were to tell me something was {$5.00} and then attempt to charge me {$5000.00}, XXXX times, and they allowed it to go through, I would think Citi should understand this is the fault of their own processing systems.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to

the card, which i did within a few minutes of the fraudulent transaction s , citi then processed xxxx more identical charges and transferred them to a new account they setup for me after cancelling the card that was used at the time of the incident. in their most recent letter they mentioned that the xxxx and xxxx charges were processed by them during a period of security closure clearance, which was after the first charge was declined by citicard, and after the card presented at the time of the incident was cancelled. i received no notification from citi of the xxxx and xxxx charges, but they themselves recognized the xxxx charge of 5000.00 was fraudulent and declined it. i have sent them numerous documents and have also engaged an attorney, xxxx xxxx to help me resolve this matter. i can provide all the documents to cfpb at your request. after citicard received the first communication from my attorney, which advised citi to not contact me directly, they did call me

5000.00 charges from xxxx xxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx on the afternoon of xxxxxxxx. i have provided cfpb with several of the documents submitted as evidence that this was deceptive criminal practices, and that

held be responsible for these charges. my credit card statement and written correspondence, received much later, confirm a different message. citicard continues to restate that since i was scammed it was not a fraudulent charge, and that since i provided my card for a 5.00 payment i am responsible for xxxx charges of 5000.00, the xxxx of which citicards themselves recognized as fraudulent, and knew to decline. they called me minutes after the incident occured incoming phone record provided in attachments - so citicards clearly recognized the xxxx charge was fraudulentsuspicious activity. the xxxx and xxxx charges were processed by citicard with no notification or authorization by me, and after the card had been cancelled. citi continues to assert that i approved the charges because i presented my credit card. this is puzzling ; i present my credit card at every in person transaction, but if any other store or vendor were to tell me something was 5.00 and then attempt to charge me 5000.00, xxxx times, and they allowed it to go through, i would think citi should understand this is the fault of their own processing systems.",2025-06,987

2025-06-06,mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Changes in loan terms during or after closing,"Dear to whom this might concern, I am filing this complaint regarding the mishandling of my mortgage application by M & T Bank. My concerns are not primarily about pricing, but about the mismanagement of the loan process including lack of transparency, repeated delays, poor communication, and pressure to accept a higher-cost portfolio product under duress. 

My mortgage contingency was XX/XX/XXXX and closing date was XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I started following up on a clean commitment letter. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that M & T had flagged the condo project as non-warrantable for two separate issues and placed it under Exception Review. I immediately requested written clarification about what was needed to reverse this determination. I was told multiple times that the issue was being worked through, ( see attachment XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) but ultimately the condo was denied without clear explanation. 

Critically, the underwriting team did not reach out to the condo 's HOA contact to obtain information before denying warrantability a basic step that other lenders took. I provided names of five lenders that had successfully financed all the other units in the same building as warrantable. I also contacted those lenders directly and confirmed all treated the building as warrantable.

Despite this, my loan officer dismissed the input and told me I wouldnt find better rates anywhere at this time and that that's the lender 's final decision. ( See attached text ) He did not engage with the XXXX, contact peer lenders, or offer clarity on what might change the decision. He also failed to respond in a timely manner to critical questions, contributing to significant stress, delays, and uncertainty. This behavior reflects a broader lack of borrower advocacy and transparency at M & T. 

Only after I escalated to an XXXX -- through a channel I was not supposed to have had access to or use ( see attachment XXXX  4 ), did the bank agree to review HOA documents. One of the two exceptions was resolved on the day of my mortgage contingency deadline. The second issue was only re-reviewed after further pressure. These delays seriously jeopardized my ability to close and created housing uncertainty for me and my XXXX son. 

There were additional inefficiencies, including : a. My Closing XXXX ( XXXX ) was issued just two business days before closing, despite repeated follow-ups. 

b. I asked on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX whether an XXXX insurance policy was required. I received no reply until XX/XX/XXXX, just two days before closing, and after my contingency deadline had passed.

The overall experience reflects a troubling pattern of bait and switch tactics, lack of transparency, poor coordination, and disregard for borrower timelines. 

I paid {$1000.00} in application and appraisal fees and was ultimately forced to restart my mortgage process with a different lender.

I believe your company has failed to comply with the requirements set forth by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), which mandates that all fees, charges, and important terms associated with a credit card application be fully disclosed and provided to the applicant prior to the submission of the application.\n\nSpecifically, I am deeply troubled by the following issues:\n\n    Failure to Provide Full Disclosure: I was not provided with a clear, upfront disclosure of the terms and fees associated with the credit card offer prior to submitting my application. Under TILA, I should have been presented with the relevant details, including any annual fees, interest rates, and charges, so that I could make an informed decision regarding whether or not to proceed with the application. However, these disclosures were not given in a timely or transparent manner, which I believe is a violation of my rights as a consumer.\n\n    Deceptive Practices: The violations stem from the copy you sent to me after with the fees already tacked on with out me prior deciding if i wanted or accept those terms of the XXXX annual fee charged immediately, (deceptions and lies)  Upon reviewing the terms after receiving my card, I discovered that the annual fee of XXXX was charged within the first five months of the cards issuance. This fee is nearly 30% of my credit limit, which is an excessive amount. Furthermore, I was not made aware of this fee upfront, and the vague response I received when I inquired about it suggests a deliberate omission of critical information. I believe these practices fall under a ""dark pattern"" of misleading tactics, which intentionally deceive the consumer and restrict their ability to make a fully informed decision.\n\n    High Interest Rates: The interest rate on the card is 36.00%, which is incredibly high and disproportionately increases the balance owed. This rate makes it nearly impossible to pay off the balance in a reasonable timeframe, thus trapping consumers in a cycle of debt. This type of practice is not only unethical but, in my opinion, predatory.\n\n    Unfair Fees and Charges: In addition to the annual fee, I have noticed several other fees being added to my account. I was not adequately informed about these fees prior to my application, nor was I given an opportunity to decline or question them.\n\nAs a consumer, I believe I have the right to receive full and truthful disclosures regarding the terms and fees associated with any credit product I consider. By omitting this information and using misleading tactics, your company has violated both my trust and my rights under the Truth in Lending Act.\n\nI request the following actions:\n\n    A full, detailed explanation of all fees, charges, and interest rates associated with this credit card.\n\n    A review of my account for potential violations of the Truth in Lending Act and a refund of any fees that were improperly charged without proper disclosure.\n\n    A reassessment of the terms of the credit card, including the high-interest rates and exorbitant annual fees, to ensure they comply with both federal regulations and ethical business practices.\n\nFailure to address these issues promptly and satisfactorily will leave me with no choice but to explore further legal action, including but not limited to, filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and seeking compensation in regarding  violations of the Truth in Lending Act.\n\nI trust that you will take this matter seriously and provide a prompt response.

2025-06-10,savings,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"To Whom It May Concern at Wells Fargo, I am writing to formally file a complaint and demand immediate restitution regarding Wells Fargos gross mishandling of a {$9500.00} cashiers check made payable to XXXX, XXXX XXXX. Due to repeated failures on your part, I was rendered literally homelessforced to sleep outside on the sidewalk in the same clothes for dayswhile my funds were locked in a system failure that no one at your institution could explain or resolve. What happened to me was preventable, inexcusable, and deeply damaging to my life, my business, and my dignity. 
On XX/XX/year>, I deposited a properly endorsed cashiers check into my Wells Fargo account. Despite this being one of the most secure financial instruments available, the deposit was inexplicably rejected. No one could tell me why. There was no internal note, no official explanation, and no one available to help. The department that made the decision simply went home for the weekend, leaving me with no access to my money and no recourse. That decision destroyed my weekand derailed my life. 
The legal copy of the cashiers check was mailed back to me without tracking, certification, or any proof of delivery. This reckless and unprofessional action placed me at risk of theft or fraud. A check of that magnitude should have been protected and tracked. It wasnt. 
This created a XXXX delay in access to my own money. And this wasnt discretionary spending. This was a cash-for-keys payoutmoney I had negotiated to secure new housing after being forced to relocate my business and residence. I had already signed paperwork and held the keys. Because I couldnt access the money, I lost the apartment. It was given to the next person in line. I now have to start the entire search over from scratch with less money, more expenses, and no place to go. 
Throughout this nightmare, I spoke to over two dozen Wells Fargo employees. Not one of them offered me an ounce of help. I was literally sleeping on a food-stained sidewalk and all I got were robotic responses like we understand how frustrating this must be. No you dont. No one who actually understood what was happening to me would have treated me this way. 
The only ray of lightthe only person who made a differencewas your employee named XXXX. She actually listened. She treated me like a human being. She gave me accurate, helpful, actionable information when no one else could. She was compassionate, clear, responsive, and made me feel like someone finally gave a XXXX. She was instrumental in helping resolve this. If Wells Fargo has even one employee to be proud of, its her. Everyone else failed to show the slightest concern for what I was going through, but XXXX showed real humanity. She restored a piece of my dignity when everything else was falling apart. 
Meanwhile, my apartment is gone. I cant show my face at U-Haul after what happened. I was forced to return the truck without fuel, because I had no money. My hotel reservations were canceled, and I was hit with cancellation fees. My public storage units first payment bounced and I was nearly locked out. My digital wallet was flagged for fraud, locked down, and is still unusable to this day. I couldnt pay the movers, who walked off the job. I had to leave behind valuable personal items because I had no way to move them. I went days without proper food or shelter. My name and reputation were damaged. All because of XXXX XXXX complete lack of competence and care. 
And when I finally received the returned check on XX/XX/XXXX, I spent over three hours in a branch managers office attempting to cash it. After all that time, I was told I couldnt cash the checkI had to redeposit it and wait again. Eight days. Thats how long Wells Fargo held onto my money while I had nothing.

One banker had the nerve to tell me, When you make a deposit, you relinquish your rights. That is offensive and unacceptable. At every point in this experience, I was treated like a criminal or a problem. Never like a customer, and certainly not like a human being in crisis. 
And dont try to deflect this onto the issuer of the check. Your people repeatedly told me to go back to the issuer and request a new check. That was legally unnecessary and practically impossible. The check was made out to XXXX, XXXX XXXX. That comma is understood legally and in banking terms as or, not and. My single endorsement was valid. Your institution chose to misapply policy, caused me financial and personal harm, and never took responsibility. 
I challenge you to listen to every one of the recorded calls on this matter. Hear the tone of voice I was met with, the indifference, the contradictions, the lack of answers, and the complete absence of urgency. I was placed on hold for XXXX minutes at a time. No XXXX was available. Every time I asked for help, I was dismissed or redirected. Except for XXXX, no one showed one ounce of care. 
As a direct result of your banks negligence : * I lost access to {$9500.00} for 8 days * I lost my new apartment * I became homeless and was forced to sleep on the sidewalk * I couldnt refuel or pay for my XXXX XXXX * I was humiliated and cant go back to XXXX XXXX I lost hotel reservations and paid cancellation fees * A public storage payment bounced and nearly locked me out * My digital wallet is still unusable * I was unable to pay the movers and had to abandon valuable items * I went without food or shelter * I was treated with condescension and robotic indifference * I suffered emotional distress, reputational harm, and severe anxiety * I was mocked with lines like We know how you feel, while I was literally surviving on {$4.00} * My first week at a new public storage facility was already compromised by your institution 's failure This isnt just about a deposit error. This is about the complete breakdown of a banks responsibility to protect, support, and respect its customersespecially in a crisis. This is about being dismissed, discarded, and disregarded by every layer of your organization while I begged for help and lived on XXXX XXXX. 
I demand : 1. A formal, written apology from Wells Fargo 2. Financial restitution of no less than {$5000.00} to cover housing losses, cancellation fees, reputational harm, and emotional distress and I reserve the right to pursue additional damages if this is not resolved promptly. 
If I do not receive a satisfactory response within XXXX hours, I will escalate this matter immediately to : * The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) * The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) * XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX And any and all relevant news media outlets and social media platforms I will tell my story publicly and in full detail.

XX/XX/XXXX, and full amount was available in my account on XX/XX/XXXX ) I was offered a new job, that later on turned out to be fraud. They sent me a check to a pay a 3rd party for equipment. I called the company to try to verify the persons I was emailing back and forth were from HR were real. When I called the company ( XXXX XXXX ) and asked to speak with HR they said they all work remote and only talk over email ( XXXX ) XXXX. I applied for this role online through XXXX. Anyways so they sent me a check for the equipment. The check cleared in Wells Fargo so I was under the impression that the funds were there, and there were no issues. Upon calling Wells Fargo they said even though the funds cleared it can take a few days for the check to actually clear. After I sent the wire transfer ( issue # 2, more details below ) and that payment cleared Wells Fargo pulled the check that cleared out of my account. When I spoke to the Wells Fargo agent on XX/XX/XXXX she even said it isn't the best process that the funds show before they were there. I said operated under the fact that the funds were there and am now out {$4900.00}. I had to pull funds out of a retirement account to replace them. 

Issue 2 : wire transfer made where banker should have seen warning signs that it was fraud. 

I went into Wells Fargo for help with a wire transfer. I was very up front with the banker that I got an offer to start a new job, they sent me a check for these funds and then they are having me wire them to another company to pay for the equipment. After talking to Wells Fargo fraud agents on XX/XX/XXXX and 4th they made it known to me that this is a well known fraud attempt. The banker should have caught this and helped me stop it. I've been out of a job for 3 months and was excited to start. I literally showed the banker my cell phone emails and texts saying what they were asking me to do and who to wire the funds to. As we went through the process ( again I felt comfortable since the check cleared in my account and I didn't know a check could be taken out of my account ) I provided the banker with all the information of who the wire transfer should go to. It was going to an individual. Again, I'm not a banker for a living- they are. That should have been another sign looking back that the banker should have helped stop this. I just showed him the text chain of all the directions I received. I was communicating with this company for a few weeks over several different email chains. I'm not sure if this company was hacked, but again I don't know why this banker didn't help me more and now I'm out {$4900.00}.

In XX/XX/XXXX, FCI and XXXX informed me that the Loan was somehow modified in a delayed process at the end of XX/XX/XXXX when just before XXXX bought the loan from XXXX XXXX in an unadvertised transaction. 
In XX/XX/XXXX the home sustained damages from a massive water leak affecting the entire house.

XXXX XXXX XXXX paid initial funds to start repairs but stopped the repairs midstream on the instructions of XXXX and FCI Lender Services Representatives who wanted to coordinate receipt and disbursement of all funds slated for home repair from the insurance company directly. In XX/XX/XXXX the insurance company informed us that they will not pay for the remaining repairs because my mortgage company was controlling the adjustment process. The insurance company advised us to repair necessary damages from personal funds until the mortgage company releases funds the insurer would send directly to them.

In the meantime, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX continued to advertise our home for foreclosure with a date that was set for XX/XX/XXXX. At around the same time, XXXX XXXX informed us that they will not renew my insurance policy on my home because the mortgage company ( FCI Lender Services and XXXX ) had terminated the Escrow Account on our mortgage. With extreme animus, harassment, persecution, and retaliation XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), FCI Lender Services XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX by all unlawful means available to them, have remained determined to take possession of my home and steal the equity I have left in it. In XX/XX/XXXX, having no options left, I was forced to file for Bankruptcy to stop the Foreclosure. In the meantime FCI and XXXX stopped communicating with me and, despite several requests, I have never heard from them again concerning the funds I borrowed to complete repairs on my home. In that bankruptcy case filed in the US Federal Bankruptcy Court for the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and XXXX filed fraudulent proofs of claims with the court that inflated the principal amount they are demanding as owing in the loan. Undeterred, XXXX and FCI have continued to withhold release of insurance funds from my Insurance Company to enable me to complete repairs on the damages. This lender and its mortgage servicers, colluding with corrupt lawfirms and attorneys to cause me harm and dispossess my home, have orchestrated extreme distress and financial difficulties for me from every angle, creating a state of constant battle fatigue and demoralization, just to keep my home. 

The judge entered a final order in the Bankruptcy case on XX/XX/XXXX which identified several areas, including ethical and unprofessional concerns on the part of creditors attorneys and the trustee bending to external influences of this Lender and its agents on activities of the court concerning my home that they have targeted. On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a Notice of Appeal with the XXXXS District Court, Fourth Circuit, to address these thorny. issues. Nevertheless, on XX/XX/XXXX -- just 2days after the Bankruptcy Court entered its final order -- FCI Lender services moved quickly and destroyed all my mortgage payment records for the entire year, leaving the account essentially in foreclosure again -- as the new FCI mortgage statement now falsely claims that I have not paid Mortgage on the account since XX/XX/XXXX. They are assessing unexplained fees of over {$22000.00} to bring the account current and cure the foreclosure status they placed on the account on XX/XX/XXXX.

I told them both transactions were made by me and not fraud on XX/XX/year>2025. 

The response on XX/XX/year>2025 was that they will look into it for 24-48 hours and then get back to me. About 26 hours later On XX/XX/year>2025 I called again and was informed that my account was going to be closed without a proper reason stated. I was supposed to be mailed that reason within seven days, and received a letter just saying my banking relationship was not sustainable from a periodic review.

2025-06-04,debt_collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"I am filing this complaint to report violations of my consumer rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) by XXXX, XXXX, and certain financial institutions that furnish information to these consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ).

1. Lack of Consent for Sharing Consumer Reports Under 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( a ), CRAs are permitted to furnish consumer reports only under specific circumstances, such as with the consumer 's written instructions or for certain permissible purposes. I have not provided any form of consentwritten, verbal, or impliedfor XXXX, XXXX, or any financial institution to share my personal information. Therefore, any sharing of my consumer report without my explicit consent is a violation of this statute.

2. Failure to Provide Opt-Out Notices According to 15 U.S.C. 6802 ( b ) and 12 CFR 1016.7, financial institutions must provide consumers with clear and conspicuous notices about their right to opt out of information sharing with nonaffiliated third parties. I have not received any such notice, nor have I been given the opportunity to exercise my right to opt out, which constitutes a violation of these provisions. 

XXXX. Reporting of Outdated Adverse Information Per 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ), CRAs are prohibited from including adverse information in consumer reports that is more than seven years old, excluding criminal convictions. XXXX  and XXXX  have reported adverse items on my credit report that exceed this seven-year limit, violating this statute. 

4. Furnishing Inaccurate Information Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), furnishers of information to CRAs must not provide information they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. Despite this, inaccurate information has been furnished to XXXX  and XXXX  regarding my credit history. 

XXXX. Inadequate Compliance Procedures As mandated by 15 U.S.C. 1681e, CRAs must maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of the information they report. The continued presence of inaccurate and outdated information on my credit reports indicates a failure by XXXX  and XXXX  to uphold this requirement. 

XXXX. Revocation of Consent and Opt-Out Request In accordance with 12 CFR 1016.7 ( i ), I am exercising my right to opt out of any information sharing with nonaffiliated third parties. This opt-out is effective immediately and will remain in effect until I provide written revocation. I expect all financial institutions and CRAs to honor this request as required by law.

Failure to Issue IRS 1099-C for Canceled Debt ( 26 U.S.C. 6050P ) XXXX has reported my debt as charged off but has not issued a 1099-C form for the canceled balance in excess of {$13000.00} as required by IRS regulations .

According to IRS rules, creditors must issue a 1099-C for debts of {$600.00} or more when forgiven or written off. By failing to do so, XXXX is improperly reporting the debt while not adhering to tax law requirements. 

Failure to Refund Credit Balances & Account Termination Rights ( 12 CFR 1026.11 ) 12 CFR 1026.11 ( a ) mandates that if a consumer has a credit balance in excess of {$1.00}, the creditor must refund it within seven business days after a written request.

Despite multiple prior complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) under case numbers XXXX and XXXX, and repeated requests dating back to XXXX, XXXX has consistently failed to provide the essential documentation legally required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

Key Issues : Failure to Validate the XXXX XXXX has repeatedly failed to provide adequate verification of the alleged debt despite multiple written requests going back as far as XXXX. To date, they have not provided : A signed original contract bearing my wet-ink signature Full account-level documentation, including itemized billing history Evidence of consideration given ( required to enforce any alleged contract ) Proof of ownership or assignment, showing Cavalry legally acquired this debt Any disclosure under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) or otherwise, required to validate the origin of this account Their CFPB Response Is Insufficient and Unsubstantiated The mere statement that a debt is valid is not equivalent to proper validation.

Licensing and Regulatory Concerns It remains unclear whether Rausch & Sturm LLP is properly licensed to collect debts in Iowa. I request that this issue be investigated, as unlicensed collection activity may be a violation of both Iowa law and FDCPA provisions.

Securitization/ Pooling of Debt I request full transparency as to whether this alleged account has been securitized, bundled, or otherwise sold as part of a pool of receivables. If so, XXXX may no longer possess legal standing to pursue collection. 

Relief Requested : I respectfully request that the CFPB direct XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to immediately provide all documentation as listed above, or withdraw their claim entirely.

Although I provided proof of payment, I continued receiving the calls. I requested an escalation to resolve the matter, several months passed before I was taken seriously and after I insisted. 
Once I was able to speak with someone, I was given the run around about my why my payments were not being applied to my account when received. I was also advised to speak with the insurance department because the issue on my account was within that department. Spoke with them and there I received the run around again for several months. Again, I insisted on a solution and accurate information. After numerous attempts an agent informed me that my escrow account was negative due to insurance pay outs. Two premium payments for hazard insurance were being paid out of my account. I informed them that I did not have two policies and that the duplicate policy needed to be corrected. The agreed to remove one of the policies to "" correct '' the issue.

After the call I was still receiving collection calls about my mortgage payment. Upon contacting them again, I was now given a different reason for the calls. Although they were receiving my payments ( on time ) they were holding the payments as unapplied payments and not processing my payments therefore creating late fees and other fees, unnecessarily. XXXX was the beginning of the pandemic however, I did not experience hardship right away and continued with my payments as agreed. Unfortunately, I was eventually impacted, and a mortgage assistance company assisted me with mortgage payment. Two separate lump sum payments were paid to Newrez/Shellpoint yet they still inaccurately reported my payments as late and charged a {$25.00} fee each month for what was considered an occupancy check. The fee was not necessary as I was in communication with them as well as the mortgage assistance company where they were made well aware that I resided at the residence and still reside there. Accurate payments were made and received from myself and the assistance company to Newrez/Shellpoint and they still incorrectly reported them.

I am writing regarding my recent loan applications submitted to LightStream/TRUIST, the most recent being on XX/XX/year>. I received a denial notice on XX/XX/year>, stating that you were unable to verify my identity. However, I find this response to be inconsistent and troubling, for the following reasons : 1. Credit Report Access : Despite the claim that my identity could not be verified, your institution was able to access my XXXX credit report, perform a hard inquiry, and provide a score of XXXX in the denial letter. This directly contradicts the reasoning for denial and raises questions about the reliability and accuracy of the process used to verify applicant identities. 
2. Inaccurate Credit Score : I have documentation showing my actual XXXX credit score is XXXX, not the XXXX reported by your institution. When I called XXXX, your representative acknowledged that discrepancies in scores "" always happen '' when reports are pulled. However, a XXXX variance is significant, especially considering that your posted APR ranges from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX  with AutoPay. As you know, credit scores are a primary factor in determining loan interest rates, and such a misrepresentation has financial consequences for the consumer.

3. Compliance Concerns : Under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), creditors are required to provide clear, accurate, and truthful information about the terms and costs of credit. Providing a materially inaccurate credit score that may affect the loan 's interest rate is a violation of this principle. 
Further, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : o I have the right to know what information is being used to make decisions about me. 
o Credit reporting agencies and users of consumer reports must ensure maximum possible accuracy in the reports.

o Adverse action notices must provide accurate and complete information, including what credit bureau was used and what specific factors led to the denial.

4. Action Requested : o I request a written explanation for the inconsistent denial reasons ( i.e., inability to verify identity versus performing a hard inquiry ).

o I request a review of the credit score discrepancy, including the exact version of the credit scoring model used ( e.g., XXXX vs XXXX ). 
o I demand assurance that no future hard inquiries will be made without verifiable identity confirmation to avoid further unnecessary damage to my credit. 
o I reserve the right to file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) if this matter is not resolved promptly and transparently.

2025-06-02,debt_collection,I do not know,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"I am filing this formal complaint against CREDIT COLLECTIONS for multiple violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692 ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) in connection with a collection account they are reporting on my credit file.

Here are the specific violations and consumer harms I am alleging : 1. Failure to Validate Debt ( FDCPA 809, 15 U.S.C. 1692g ) I exercised my right under the FDCPA to request full and complete validation of the alleged debt being reported and collected by CREDIT COLLECTIONS Despite my written request, CREDIT COLLECTIONS failed to provide : A signed agreement bearing my signature ; A detailed accounting of the alleged amount owed; Proof they are legally authorized to collect this debt ; A copy of the original creditors documentation proving the debt is valid and accurate.

Until such validation is provided, no collection activity or credit reporting is permitted by law.

2. Reporting Inaccurate and Unverified Information ( FCRA 623, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ) CREDIT COLLECTIONS is reporting information to the credit bureaus without verifying its accuracy, in direct violation of the FCRA. 
When I disputed the account with both CREDIT COLLECTIONS and the credit reporting agencies, CREDIT COLLECTIONS failed to conduct a reasonable investigation and continued to furnish the disputed information, despite not validating it.

3. Failure to Mark the Account as Disputed ( FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) ) CREDIT COLLECTIONS has not marked the account as disputed with any of the major credit bureaus, even though I sent a formal written dispute. This is a clear violation of the FCRAs requirement to report an account as disputed once the consumer challenges its accuracy.

4. Potential Re-aging of the Account ( FCRA & FDCPA Violations ) The date of last activity or first delinquency appears to have been manipulated to keep the collection account on my credit file longer than legally allowed, which constitutes illegal re-aging. This is a deceptive practice and violates both the FDCPA and FCRA.

5.

2025-04-10,savings,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"Im submitting this complaint regarding a chargeback case with Bank of America involving approximately {$16000.00} in fraudulent transactions made using my debit card. These transactions were with international merchants located in countries such as XXXX and XXXX. I have no relationship with these merchants and never provided my personal information to them. I did not receive any goods or services, and there are no contracts, signatures, or proof linking me to these purchases. 

When I initially filed the dispute on XX/XX/year>, the case was closed within XXXX hours without a proper investigation. A supervisor later admitted that Bank of America did not contact any of the merchants involved. The case was denied based on vague reasoning that the pattern of transactions didnt appear to be an attempt to drain my account. This reasoning is not sufficient for a denial, especially when international merchants and potentially fraudulent intermediaries are involved.

I have spoken to multiple supervisors ( at least three separate occasions ) regarding this case, and they have acknowledged the lack of investigation on the initial decision. The case was eventually escalated and reopened. The bank has now sent out chargebacks to the merchants, but I am still being denied a provisional credit simply because the original decision was a denial. This is unfair, especially since the denial was based on incomplete and flawed reasoning. I should not be penalized for a mistake that the bank has already acknowledged. 

In the meantime, I am bearing the financial burden of these unauthorized transactions. I am requesting that the CFPB assist in urging Bank of America to issue a provisional credit while the chargeback process is underway, and to ensure that a proper, fair investigation is conducted.

The following are my grievances : 1. Harassment and Unauthorized Contact with My Family and Social Media Contact Faith Financial has repeatedly contacted my family members about my account, which is a violation of privacy laws and unethical collection practices. 
I was contacted via XXXX XXXX regarding my account, despite never consenting to social media communication and not being given an option to opt out of this form of contact. 
Excessive calls : I received multiple phone calls per day from their office, and personal phones.This behavior is considered harassment under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ).

2. Threats of Wage Garnishment on a Secured Loan Faith Financial threatened to garnish my wages without obtaining a court order, which is a misrepresentation of their legal authority.

The loan is secured by five items as collateral ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), and they have not attempted repossession before pursuing other collection methods. 
Louisiana law requires a court judgment before wage garnishment can take place, yet Faith Financial attempted to intimidate me with threats before any legal proceedings had occurred. 



XXXX. Unexplained and Unauthorized Charges A receipt from Faith Financial shows a charge of {$170.00} labeled as Other, with no explanation for this charge.

When I called to request clarification, XXXX, an employee, yelled at me and then hung up instead of addressing my concerns professionally. 
Another employee, XXXX, was present and heard XXXX yelling at me. This unprofessional and hostile treatment is unacceptable.

4. Unauthorized Payment Processing Faith Financial processed a payment from my account after it had already been sent to collections.

This raises serious concerns regarding their handling of accounts, potential unauthorized transactions, and deceptive business practices.

At this time, I didnt have any documents in my profile nor had I received any letters in the mail on an update with the investigation. I called Barclay to find out why the charge was added back. After some back and forth with the representative, I was told that because the email attached to the transaction matched the email they had on file, it was deemed as not fraudulent. It took them over 30 days to decide that it wasnt fraudulent based off the email. I asked if they even contacted the merchant ( XXXX ) directly as I had an open investigation with them as well and I was informed that they had not contacted the merchant and based their decision solely off the email. I requested it be reviewed again and that they contact the merchant directly. I would also like to note that I mentioned to them that I had not received any formal documentation as of that phone call detailing the result of their investigation. After getting off the phone, I received a notification that a document was ready to review in my account.

On XX/XX/year>, I called a phone number listed in XXXX XXXX as XXXX and asked for an update on the refund. The phone number was ( XXXX ) XXXX. This phone number is a fraud/spoof number pretending to be associated with XX/XX/XXXX as I soon realized. ( see Attachment A for Official Statement from the REAL XXXX ). 
When I innocently called the fraudulent number to ask for my refund, I was given profuse apologies and was reassured that they would send my XXXX XXXX refund immediately, as soon as I provided my card information. I did so. The agent identified himself as XXXX. 
I checked my Citi Bank balance, only to discover to my horror that instead of a refund of {$1000.00}, my account had been debited {$470.00}. I called XXXX XXXX, and they told me that they had already sent my full refund, with no cancellation fee, to XXXX, and that I should receive it soon.

I was appalled to see that the Investigator COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTOOD the premise of the dispute. It was not the {$1000.00} that was in question, it was the fraudulent {$470.00} taken by the fake XX/XX/XXXX 
I have been tangling with Citi over this for almost 9 months. Unacceptable. Citi does not appear to have done a meaningful investigation. I finally reached an excellent Supervisor, XXXX, on or around Friday XXXX XXXX and she completely understood my actual complaint. She advised me to get an official statement from XXXX, stating that the fake number ( the one attached to the theft of my money ) is NOT associated with the REAL XX/XX/XXXX, and that AA refunded me fully with no cancellation fee, and the REAL XX/XX/XXXX forwarded my {$1000.00} to me with no cancellation fee.

Only XXXX transaction posted correctly at {$670.00}. The remaining three transactions posted at {$3000.00} each, which is over XXXX times the expected price and completely unreasonable for a one-way, non-direct flight to XXXX. 

I immediately contacted XXXX, expecting them to acknowledge a possible pricing or technical error. However, they refused to assist or investigate.

My first dispute was closed on the grounds that I had not provided documentation, even though I was told my credit card statement showing the price discrepancy would be sufficient. 

I reopened the case and submitted my billing statements along with a receipt showing the correct {$670.00} charge.

So every around third of the month I get paid well this particular month I had forgotten my login information. So when I got paid and my rent was due I was having problems signing into my account and withdrawing my money because I had forgotten my PIN and my password. So I called NetSpend with a simple request to reset my password. So I was on hold for a minimum of 3 hours for the first time just for them to tell me that I needed identity verification which is understandable right? But then I told them that my wallet and my phone had just been stolen because I had and I did not have access to any of those things anymore. So then I asked them if I could verify my account some other way because I had remembered well my fiance had remembered that one time they had verified me by asking me some questions like where I lived in the past what state I was from and all that. They continue to tell me that they could not do that this time because I had locked myself out of my account which I locked myself out of my account many times before and it didn't matter but anyways so they put me on hold again because they wanted me to speak to a general manager and they wanted me to then speak to an account specialist well by this time I was pretty infuriated so I called him some choice names and then they put me on hold once again for another hour and a half only for somebody to come back on the phone and tell me that if I did not switch all my money out of my account within the next half an hour they were going to close my account I did not have another bank account at that time I didn't have anything at that time because my wallet my phone everything I had previously been stolen.

I received a spoofed text message and phone call impersonating USAAs fraud department from what appeared to be their legitimate number claiming suspicious activity.

Under their guidance, I unknowingly authorized a {$20000.00} transfer after the fraudster moved my savings into checking to allow the transaction to go through. 
I realized something was wrong immediately after and contacted USAA directly.

Two follow-up calls ( one of which ended with me being told the representative had gone home for the day ). 
I was then told that a legal copy of the check was mailed to me without any notice, confirmation, or tracking despite my financial situation and homelessness. 
This mishandling is beyond negligent. Recklessly putting a {$9500.00} legal copy of said check into the mail without certifying? Without formal notice? This is beyond negligent and I have been unable to pay for services i already received as a result! Also I am currently homeless and have no access to funds. 
My cell phone service is about to be disconnected, cutting me off from work opportunities and emergency communication. 
I have no access to the {$9500.00} that rightfully belongs to me, with no timeline or resolution from Wells Fargo. 
Wells Fargos failure to provide clear, consistent communication and safeguard a major financial transaction has directly endangered my well-being. I urgently request that the CFPB : Investigate Wells Fargos handling of this deposit ; Ensure my funds are returned immediately ; Hold the bank accountable for the hardship this has caused. 
Please contact me as soon as possible. I am in urgent need of resolution, and any help the CFPB can provide would be appreciated beyond words.

While I was out of work and XXXX  for four months due to an XXXX, I fell behind on my bills. During this time, I contacted Chase to request temporary payment assistance, but I was informed that no payment plans were available. As a result, late fees and interest continued to accumulate, making it impossible for me to meet even the minimum payment. As a single mother with no child support, relying on food pantries, and struggling with basic living expenses, I could only prioritize rent and food with my XXXX checks. Around the holidays, I even required assistance from a friend to pay my utility bill. 

Upon returning to work, I contacted Chase to request the removal of late fees and interest charges so I could pay my balance in full and utilize my card again. My credit limit was {$4500.00}. While the late fees were waived, the interest charges remained. Before making a payment, I specifically asked two customer service representatives whether my credit limit would remain the same and whether my account would stay active. Both representatives assured me that my account would be brought up to date with no changes to my credit limit or access to using the card. They even congratulated me on my bigger payment. 

Based on this confirmation, I proceeded with a {$3000.00} payment. However, the very next day, my card was declined. When I checked my account, I discovered that Chase had turned my card OFF and reduced my credit limit from {$4500.00} to $ XXXX the assurances I received. This unexpected change has left me in an extremely difficult financial position. 

I trusted the information provided by the representatives, and the recorded calls will confirm these conversations. Had I been informed that my credit limit would be reduced, I would have reconsidered making such a large payment in one lump sum. Given the current economic conditions, rising costs of living, and my ongoing medical treatments, this decision has placed a significant burden on me as a consumer.

I respectfully request that my credit limit be reinstated or, at the very least, that I be provided with a resolution that allows me access to the funds I worked so hard to pay back!! I am asking Chase to honor the information given to me by their representatives. Please review the recorded calls for verification.

2025-05-21,credit_card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"I experienced a XXXX  and XXXX XXXX  in early 2025, which caused me to miss payments on several credit cards. Once I was safe and able to take action, I logged into the Wells Fargo mobile app and chose to pay the full Total Balance displayed {$7700.00} on XX/XX/scrub>, 2025. The app also showed a smaller Statement Balance, but I intentionally chose the Total Balance so that all interest, penalties, and fees would be covered and the card brought to XXXX. 

Immediately after submitting that payment, the app showed a new charge of {$40.00}, but I was blocked from paying it. The app said I couldnt make another payment because one had just been processed. I had to wait a day before I was allowed to pay the {$40.00} which I did on XX/XX/year>2025. That again brought the balance to zero. 

A month later, Wells Fargo added another charge {$58.00} which they claimed was for interest and penalties related to the late payment. I contacted them to explain : I understood I had been late.

I deliberately paid the full Total Balance ( not the statement balance ) and then paid the unexpected {$40.00} as soon as the app allowed.

I was asking them to let me pay everything they claimed I owed, including any interest and late fees, to fully resolve and close the matter.

Instead of giving me a final payoff amount, they kept replying, But you paid it late, and refused to accept that I was repeatedly trying to pay everything off in full. I kept telling them I know its late but I should be able to pay everything I owe, interest and penalties on an account that has been closed for months instead of this engineered perpetual circular debt that can not be resolved and all they would say is but you paid it late in repetition and that "" interest and penalties will continue to accrue as long as you pay late, even though I kept paying the full amounts as soon as they were shown to me.

I was told "" but you paid late '' in repetition to me saying I know that but was attempting to pay everything I owed including late fees and interest so that no charges would occur again like they couldn't hear me or were trying to anger me and that interest and penalties will continue to accrue as long as you pay late, as if I wasnt trying to satisfy the account paying all fees, interest and principle without delay. I was paying the entire Total Balance as soon as a balance was shown, trying to resolve it completely. Despite my full payments each time a balance appeared, new charges would reappear, and I was again told, theyll keep occurring as long as you pay late. This made it impossible to escape the loop, despite my repeated efforts to bring the account to XXXX 

Other credit card companies I dealt with during this time simply allowed me to pay what I owed and closed the account. Wells Fargo was the only one that refused to accept full payment and kept the account in a fee loop. Today, after extensive back and forth, they finally told me they will allow me to pay the {$58.00} and bring the balance to XXXX  without adding more charges. I will monitor the account to confirm.

However, I still believe their behavior was intentional and exploitative.

Why Im filing this complaint : The app misrepresented Total Balance as a complete payoff, but allowed new charges immediately afterward and then continue to accrue fees.

I was blocked from paying the {$40.00} that appeared immediately after the full payment when I wanted to pay all fees.

Wells Fargo refused to provide a final payoff amount even after I paid in full and then again.

They told me interest and penalties would continue to accrue as long as I pay late, despite my efforts to pay the full balance and all charges each time they appeared.

2025-05-15,savings,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"Ive been a loyal Regions Bank customer for 14 years. Since XXXX XXXXthe same month I suffered my XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXIve been charged a total of {$4000.00} in overdraft fees. These include : - {$570.00} in XX/XX/XXXX - {$680.00} in XX/XX/XXXX ( before a {$430.00} refund ) - {$280.00} in XX/XX/XXXX - {$320.00} in XX/XX/XXXX - {$390.00} in XX/XX/XXXX - {$210.00} in XX/XX/XXXX - {$570.00} in XX/XX/XXXX - {$570.00} in XX/XX/XXXX - {$390.00} in XX/XX/XXXX ( before a {$100.00} refund ) These fees follow a recurring and harmful pattern : Im regularly charged the maximum number of overdraft fees allowed per day ( {$36.00} XXXX ), across multiple days per month. This pattern did not exist before XX/XX/XXXX. Prior to that, I had no history of excessive overdraft activity. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, after breaking down while picking up a rent check at my local Regions branch, I explained the situation to an employee. She listened and kindly refunded {$430.00} in overdraft fees after I told her about my strokes her own mother had experienced one, and she understood. Im deeply grateful for that compassion.

However, the same overdraft fee pattern continued in the months that followed. Despite that initial act of help, the systemic issue remained unaddressed, and I was once again overwhelmed with fees totaling thousands of dollars. 

Ive contacted Regions for assistance, but have only received partial relief. These fees have made my financial recovery nearly impossible. 

In addition to the repeated fee pattern, Ive also been charged overdraft fees on days when my account was not overdrawn. I had a positive balance at the time of some transactions, but Regions still assessed overdraft fees when those charges posted later. I believe this practice is similar to the authorized-positive overdraft fees that Regions was previously penalized for by the CFPB in XXXX. 

Most recently, on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, my paycheck was deposited and overdraft fees were deducted immediately afterward before I had the chance to use any of my funds. This happens every pay period and demonstrates how I remain trapped in a harmful fee cycle that Regions has failed to address. 

As a direct result of these repeated overdraft fees, I have now fallen behind on a student loan payment. When Regions deducts hundreds of dollars in fees after my paycheck posts, I am left with little to meet essential obligations. This financial damage is not just emotional its structural, and its already starting to affect my credit and long-term stability. Im doing everything I can to stay afloat, and these fees are pushing me further behind. 

I am also aware that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took enforcement action against Regions Bank in XXXX for illegal and unfair overdraft practices, resulting in over {$190.00} XXXX in penalties and customer reimbursements. My current experience suggests that these harmful practices may still be occurring in a different form. 

Despite Regions having been held accountable for similar behavior, the pattern of excessive and repeated overdraft fees Ive faced since my XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX shows a continued failure to protect vulnerable customers. I respectfully ask the CFPB to consider this enforcement history in reviewing my case, and to help ensure appropriate reimbursement and safeguards are implemented.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION,AL,352XX,,Consent provided,Web,5/15/2025,Closed with explanation,Yes,,13505910,"ive been a loyal regions bank customer for 14 years. since xxxx xxxxthe same month i suffered my xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxive been charged a total of 4000.00 in overdraft fees. these include - 570.00 in xxxxxxxx - 680.00 in xxxxxxxx before a 430.00 refund - 280.00 in xxxxxxxx - 320.00 in xxxxxxxx - 390.00 in xxxxxxxx - 210.00 in xxxxxxxx - 570.00 in xxxxxxxx - 570.00 in xxxxxxxx - 390.00 in xxxxxxxx before a 100.00 refund these fees follow a recurring and harmful pattern im regularly charged the maximum number of overdraft fees allowed per day 36.00 xxxx , across multiple days per month. this pattern did not exist before xxxxxxxx. prior to that, i had no history of excessive overdraft activity. in xxxxxxxx, after breaking down while picking up a rent check at my local regions branch, i explained the situation to an employee. she listened and kindly refunded 430.00 in overdraft fees after i told her about my strokes her own mother had experienced one, and she understood. im deeply grateful for that compassion. however, the same overdraft fee pattern continued in the months that followed. despite that initial act of help, the systemic issue remained unaddressed, and i was once again overwhelmed with fees totaling thousands of dollars. ive contacted regions for assistance, but have only received partial relief. these fees have made my financial recovery nearly impossible. in addition to the repeated fee pattern, ive also been charged overdraft fees on days when my account was not overdrawn. i had a positive balance at the time of some transactions, but regions still assessed overdraft fees when those charges posted later. i believe this practice is similar to the authorized-positive overdraft fees that regions was previously penalized for by the cfpb in xxxx. most recently, on friday, xxxxxxxx, my paycheck was deposited and overdraft fees were deducted immediately afterward before i had the chance to use any of my funds. this happens every pay period and demonstrates how i remain trapped in a harmful fee cycle that regions has failed to address. as a direct result of these repeated overdraft fees, i have now fallen behind on a student loan payment. when regions deducts hundreds of dollars in fees after my paycheck posts, i am left with little to meet essential obligations. this financial damage is not just emotional its structural, and its already starting to affect my credit and long-term stability. im doing everything i can to stay afloat, and these fees are pushing me further behind. i am also aware that the consumer financial protection bureau took enforcement action against regions bank in xxxx for illegal and unfair overdraft practices, resulting in over 190.00 xxxx in penalties and customer reimbursements. my current experience suggests that these harmful practices may still be occurring in a different form. despite regions having been held accountable for similar behavior, the pattern of excessive and repeated overdraft fees ive faced since my xxxx in xxxxxxxx shows a continued failure to protect vulnerable customers. i respectfully ask the cfpb to consider this enforcement history in reviewing my case, and to help ensure appropriate reimbursement and safeguards are implemented.",2025-05,527

Factual Dispute of Alleged Debt The account in question, Account # XXXX, reflects an alleged balance of {$1500.00}, yet : 1. I have never entered into any agreement, contract, or financial obligation with XXXX or any related creditor regarding this balance. 
2. This account was fraudulently placed on my credit report in violation of my legal rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ).

3. There is no legally enforceable contract bearing my signature to substantiate any obligation to this debt.

Clear Violations of Consumer Protection Laws Your actions in reporting this account without proper verification violate the following federal consumer protection laws : 1. Lack of Legal Obligation & Enforceable Contract Under federal law, a debt can not be enforced or collected unless there is an agreement signed by the consumer.

3. Failure to Notify Before Reporting Negative Information 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) of the FCRA requires prior written notice before an account is placed on a consumers credit report. I was never notified, making this a blatant violation.

4. Unlawful Collection Attempts & Harassment Any attempt to collect a debt that is not validated, enforceable, or legitimately owed by the consumer is a direct violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692e ( prohibiting false or misleading representations ) and 1692f ( prohibiting unfair collection practices ).

Does it mean, that my current mortgage interest rate, which is fixed 4 %, may change? I will be very surprised, since it is going to be a modification, and not a refinancing.
