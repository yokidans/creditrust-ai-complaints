        "i am filing this complaint because steel river systems , llc made threatening statements regarding legal action in connection with a debt i do not owe and have disputed. my previous cfpb complaint focused on these threats. steel river responded by providing a basic debt verification letter, but completely ignored the allegation of threatening legal action which was the primary issue. they never denied it, addressed it, or justified their behavior. the cfpb then marked the case as closed despite this key issue being left unresolved. the alleged debt originated from a fraudulent check that xxxx xxxx xxxx accepted and processed in xxxx. xxxx later charged off and closed the account, and i believe they likely recovered the funds through insurance or internal procedures. at no point was i held legally responsible by xxxx. years later, steel river systems is claiming ownership of this alleged debt despite no proof of ownership or assignment from xxxx no documentation showing the debt is valid, collectible, or lawfully transferred and most importantly, they made threats of legal action in their phone communication with me. i have a recording of the call with steel river systems. at the beginning of the call, i informed the representative that i was recording the conversation, and she continued without objection. in the call, she made misleading and aggressive threats of legal action without establishing a legal basis or disclosing my consumer rights. this behavior is in direct violation of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa , 15 u.s.c. 807, which prohibits false, deceptive, or misleading statements during collection attempts.",

        "this is a follow-up to a previous cfpb complaint i submitted regarding national commercial services ncs , a debt collection agency based in xxxx xxxx xxxx california. in my original complaint, i explained national commercial services tricked me into signing a contract without verifying whether the debt was mine. they used scare tactics and contacted family members, continuing to harass me for years. they threatened to sue me and revoke my license. i was a young, nave woman at the time, and they used aggressive and coercive language that pushed me into panicking and signing a contract. on xxxxyear, they sent me a letter saying they were consulting an attorney but i could call to get it resolved. once calmed down and researched the situation, i discovered that many other people had been similarly manipulated by this company into signing repayment agreements through scare tactics. ncs has been contacting me for over five years. that information remains unchanged - and ncs s response failed to address the central issue that i was coerced into a contract through unlawful and deceptive practices. they responded with a general defense of the debt but did not answer to their misconduct or the tactics used to force me into the agreement. i want to be let out of this contract that they illegally scared me into. they also have not reported anything to my credit report in about the 5 years they have harassed me. but their scare tactics in the first few years caused me to panic into signing a contract. i heavily urge the cfpb to do an investigation on behalf of all clients this company has harassed. ncs has an average of xxxx stars on their xxxx xxxx page with over xxxx views with common complaints. help us out, please! i want to be released from this illegal entanglement. i am now submitting additional documentation"
